Mahler,Shutter Island<U+FEFF>
Mahler,Who could not like this. <U+00A0>It was also nice in the movie Shutter Island as part of the soundtrack.<U+FEFF>
Mahler,"beautiful! the first time I heard this piece was a Monzo midi-record (!), made 5-12-2008, do you know if there are earlier records -performances with musical instruments?<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,"I first was introduced to this haunting beautiful piece while watching Shutter Island This Quartet does a breathtaking performance of this piece!!!  Bravo!
 <U+FEFF>"
Mahler,"Such beautiful Romantic piece of ART........    ;,)<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,this is post perfection !!<U+FEFF>
Mahler,Shutter Island<U+FEFF>
Mahler,Magnifique interpretation... ! <3<U+FEFF>
Mahler,i am the guy who turns the pages. any questions?<U+FEFF>
Mahler,"My god how can some one dislike this? like silvery wine flowing on a spaceship, a bird of rarest spun metal! <U+FEFF>"
Mahler,"ah...there are some musicians behind the mics :-)
<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,"I also was introduced to this little gem by the movie, Shutter Island. Now, my world of classical music has me diving into hitherto unknown string quartets! A good performance! Wish I could have been in the front row for this one!<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,9:35 I didn't know Matt LeBlanc played cello. <U+FEFF>
Mahler,"this performance is absolutely incredible! well done, you've perfected one of my favorite pieces, and now I account for about the last 1000 views!<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,Estupendo!! <U+FEFF>
Mahler,"Such a breathtaking, good performers although something happened in the performance,  well live is live always. Bruckner has both a string quintet and quartet if someone didn´t know
<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,Brilliant and heartfelt performance! Thanks for sharing.<U+FEFF>
Mahler,Magnifico. Gracias.<U+FEFF>
Mahler,"EXQUISITE Performance !  
 Mahler @ age 16 !!!<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,Beautiful.  Simply beautiful.<U+FEFF>
Mahler,"Im 15, and this is actaully my favorite song. I listen to it repeatedly. It is beautiful!<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,Bravo...<U+FEFF>
Mahler,"Everything is perfect, right down to the venue and its backdrop--what a treat to discover this amazing performance on Mahler's 151st birthday!<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,"@PianoHero1994 I think it's ironic, because classical music (especially in the late 19th century and early 20th), a lot of composers and pieces wrote pieces which I felt could easily relate to the anxiety and adolescent conflicts. Modern pop and hip hop are so devoid of authenticity and emotion I would think they would make poor outlets for young and troubled minds.<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,Heartbreaking<U+FEFF>
Mahler,that piano opening always reminds me of building steam with a grain of salt dj shadow<U+FEFF>
Mahler,The first time I heard this was from Shutter Island but it is now one of my favorite pieces!<U+FEFF>
Mahler,@PianoHero1994i love classical music..im 19. but yah i know what you mean FUCK JUSTIN BIEBER<U+FEFF>
Mahler,"@PianoHero1994 
It's because they allow others to influence them too much.
And doing that they'll only listen to their modern music and not stop to listen to other kinds.
I'm a teen and am proud to enjoy both classical and rock.<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,"So beautiful, I have no words. Why is classical music so under appreciated by teens? Honestly hardly any teens listen to music of this level of beauty. Its a real shame. <U+FEFF>"
Mahler,So beautiful!<U+FEFF>
Mahler,"the great thing about classical pieces like this (i also love symphony no.6 by mahler - also very dark and powerful) is that because there are no words, nothing parts you from the music (in my understanding the language of the soul, the feeling). Everyone associates something different with words, and you can never really tell what you feel, there's always a lost part. It feels like a beautiful memory from your lost childhood, like a distant homeland and it's forgotten magical language.
<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,good job<U+FEFF>
Mahler,<U+627E>了<U+5F88>久了<U+FEFF>
Mahler,I COULD NOT SAY A WORD FOR THE MUSIC~~~~AMAZING~<U+FEFF>
Mahler,wonderful！！！！！！！！！I COULD NOT SAID A WORD FOR THE MUSIC~<U+FEFF>
Mahler,wonderful！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！<U+FEFF>
Mahler,"Now we are preparing  CDs Piano Quartets by Beethoven, G.Mahler and J.Turina and Two Great String Quartets by Beethoven No. 4 Op.18, No.4 and String Quartet Op.132 <U+FEFF>"
Mahler,@FlamencoPuro1 His symphonies are actually incredible. Probably one of the most intimate composers on an orchestral level. The colours and textures and emotions he achieves in his large scale works are ethereal. <U+FEFF>
Mahler,@superdevan makes you want to give up everything lol. Such a deep piece...<U+FEFF>
Mahler,好演奏！<U+FEFF>
Mahler,Mahler's quartet is such a treasure! I had no idea that he composed music at this level of intimacy.<U+FEFF>
Mahler,I love the surroundings and atmosphere.... makes this piece all the more wonderful !! Love you Mahler. <U+FEFF>
Mahler,"This is just... Magnificent.
Simply Magnificent.
Best performance of this piece I've ever seen!<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,Thanks!!!!!<U+FEFF>
Mahler,"@Lukecash12  Totally agree, this is by far the most profound and amazing performance of that piece I ever heard, so moving. I have to look up these guys, they are so good<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,"Wonderful performane!
i didn't know this beautiful piece before watchig the movie Shutter Island.<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,"Wonderful performane!
i didn't know this beautiful piece before watchig the movie Shutter Island.<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,Beautiful.<U+FEFF>
Mahler,Beautiful.<U+FEFF>
Mahler,"yes 15 or 16.
Very deep and full of emotion<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,"Same thing here! I was doing Mahler's 8th Symphony (in the choir). A friend of mine and I was watching this and I knew this was Mahler straight away! And whispered to him, this is Mahler! And Leonardo said, it's Mahler. Haha.<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,Wow this is so amazingly played<U+FEFF>
Mahler,Wowowowowowow is all I can say!!! Why haven't I heard of you guys before! ABSOLUTELY DIVINE!!!<U+FEFF>
Mahler,"I'm the staff accompanist at Providence College, and will be performing this on a student recital.  What a wonderful resource YouTube is!  Great piece, great performance!<U+FEFF>"
Mahler,"Amazing performance. Perfect balance of dynamics, no one part dominates, and each rises above the others for a moment or two to interject into the piece.<U+FEFF>"

Strauss,"C'est un veritable regal , y compris de la part de l'altiste soliste peut etre un peu trop reserve...Bravo!<U+FEFF>"
Strauss,"Richard Strauss, a pure genius.....
Wonderful performance by the great<U+00A0>Mischa Maisky and the superb conductor Sawallisch.
Many thanks for posting it.....<U+FEFF>"
Strauss,"Glorious account of The Don, Mischa Maisky and Sawallisch are both outstanding. This is the most beautiful and wondrous of Strauss' many tone poems and other orchestral works (with the possible exception of Tod Und Verklarung, and maybe Also Sprach Zarathustra). Extraordinary performances all around. The violist might be a little lacking in personality but otherwise does an excellent job.<U+FEFF>"
Strauss,amo-te Strauss<U+FEFF>
Strauss,Fantastic!!!<U+FEFF>
Strauss,"This is a very good performance of Richard Strauss ' tone poem Don Quixhote, a rich and glorious work given a virtuoso and subtle performance by both soloists, the NHK Orchestra from Japan under the supremely commanding and musical direction of Wolfgang Sawallisch.<U+FEFF>"
Strauss,E excelente<U+FEFF>
Strauss,mischa maisky!<U+FEFF>
Strauss,BELLISIIMO!<U+FEFF>
Strauss,Flashy shirt. I love it.<U+FEFF>
Strauss,GRAN OBRA<U+FEFF>
Strauss,"Without music, life would be a mistake and this is what he mean.<U+FEFF>"
Strauss,"cymbal player, ew.  gross.<U+FEFF>"
Strauss,Good orchestra!<U+FEFF>
Strauss,"Hombre, estos poemas sinfonicos son tan adecuados, que genial compositor, el mejor compositor del siglo XX, estoy de acuerdo con Glenn Gould, es qu esu musica tiene todo, atonalidad y tonalidad, expresionismo, impresionismo, romanticismo e incluso dodecafonismo en algunas partes<U+FEFF>"
Strauss,Amazing! Love Strauss x<U+FEFF>
Strauss,I'm really drawn to the Don--he's such an idealist--and Strauss really captures<U+00A0>his personality in music<U+FEFF>
Strauss,DELICIOSA MUSICA<U+FEFF>
Strauss,"Don Quixote changes the spear for the cello  bow, more peaceful.<U+FEFF>"
Strauss,Sawallisch e splendido dirigendo questo poema sinfonico.<U+FEFF>
Strauss,WOW<U+FEFF>
Strauss,Which orchestra is this?<U+FEFF>
Strauss,Very good performance!<U+FEFF>
Strauss,"The ending, around 35 and a half minutes in, faintly reminds me of the end of the first movement of Brahms' Second Symphony...<U+FEFF>"
Strauss,O sonho e o alivio das miserias dos que as tem acordados... Cervantes<U+FEFF>
Strauss,A worthy interpretation of this great work.<U+00A0><U+FEFF>

Strauss,whats the name of the violist?<U+FEFF>
Strauss,10:50<U+FEFF>
Strauss,wunderbar !!!<U+FEFF>
Strauss,"Which orchestra, please?<U+FEFF>"
Strauss,Poor performance by the violist...<U+FEFF>
Strauss,well it was 10/10 until maisky showed up<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Dear Jin Cho, this is one of the most beautiful interpretations of Clair de lune I have ever hear. Beautiful phrasing and beautiful choreography of your wrists and hands on the keyboard. Bravo to you.Seymour Bernstein<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,"Right now, it is 5:07 am, dark outside, i can here the rain hitting my rooftop and dripping off the roof, and here i am, cozy, in my warm bed and pj’s, listening to this beautifully interpreted piece performed by an amazing pianist. Life could not be more perfect at this moment.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,This is how I imagine watercolors to sound like<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"He is not playing, he is kissing the keyboard with his fingers!<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,Honestly when I'm on my deathbed (if I make it there) I want this playing so I can let myself go.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,I have never heard this piece played like this. Its amazing.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Exquisite performance played the way I think it was exactly what Debussy had in mind when he wrote it.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"When there's no audience, when the musician is completely relaxed, when there's enough purity and the ego is out of the way, the most sublime vibrations of the soul manifest themselves. You are God's instrument when you interpret this piece  ...<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,I feel like this song has a lot of emotions it's like a story without words :v pure Art<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Amazing playing. You had my 6th grade class of 30 students in complete silence and awe<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Extraordinary...so many pianists bucher this master piece with a soulless performance. Happy to hear someone who truly feel this beautiful music. When you,as a pianist, can imagine the moon playing hide and seek with clouds in a dark night, you fully understand ''clair de lune''.Each note should be an unexpected ray of light through the clouds. There is a kind of chaos in this music, unplanned emotional bursts. And that's why it is very hard to play. It's not about technics, it's about feelings<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,"I don't want to sound weird here, but this young man played Clair de lune by making love to it while playing. By the way just one word from me to sum his performance . . . Perfect!<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,This should have millions of views<U+FEFF>
Debussy,how can anyone dislike this?? T.T<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Chopin Playing Debussy<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Talking to the moon...<U+0001F318><U+FEFF>
Debussy,Best version I ever heard.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Definitely the best performance of Clair De Lune in YouTube.<U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB><U+FEFF>
Debussy,I was very fortunate to see him play this in concert as an encore. I know this piece well but he made it new for me. Thanks for sharing.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,superb light touch best piano performance of this I've heard<U+FEFF>
Debussy,My god that was sob worthy. This has to be the most beautiful pieces ever written for the piano.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Everything he plays is brilliant. I’m convinced he’s mastered everything from the romantic era<U+FEFF>
Debussy,He plays this as if he is inhaling and exhaling moonlight. His performance truly pierces my heart - BRAVO!<U+FEFF>
Debussy,FINALLY!!! Someone who plays the exquisite Clair De Lune the way my dear mother played it... with depth of emotion... with feeling... with their heart. SO pleased to have found this performance. Much gratitude & a heartfelt thank you.<U+0001F495><U+0001F495><U+0001F495><U+FEFF>
Debussy,This piece makes me appreciate life and how grateful I am to still be alive having my family and friends <U+2764><U+FE0F> just PRECIOUS<U+FEFF>
Debussy,피아니스트의 마음이 실려있는 영롱한 달빛이 쏟아져내리네요...오늘 어지러운 제 맘을 씻기우는 고마운 피아노 소리입니다..<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Que talento, bellisimo.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,Una vez escuchando a cho quisiera que el tocara todas las obras. Es realmente impresionante.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"I firmly believe that from now on, this will be the definitive be all and end all recording of this piece, idk how more beautiful and magestic can you get than this, I used to like this piece but not love it so much because I was never convinced enough, now I am tho, his sound is just on freaking point!!!<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,"Wow!  Really gentle and yet charged with a deep power.. Best performance of this tune I've heard without doubt.. So many people rush it, when it's all about the lingering notes :) 
I'm learning it myself at the moment, and now realise, after hearing this, that my attempts are like a noisy fog horn floundering in the dark at sea!  But with this performance of it here, my determination to learn it well  has been infused with a most incredible inspiration. Thank you so much! :)<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,"The tenderness of his playing.... I was afraid to exhale for fear of affecting the moment.  A living person is capable of something so stunning, what can't we do?<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,The best interpretation of this work that I have ever heard.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Divine. Absolute perfection.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Wonderful brought me near tears. What a splendid performance. And Mr. Bernstein is correct, this IS the most  beautiful interpretation of Clair de lune I have ever heard also. Wonderful!<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,he's incredibly lovely...<U+FEFF>
Debussy,I am speechless. Such a delicate and pensive interpretation of this piece. Beautifully done Seong-jin Cho.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,This reminds me of my childhood for some reason... walking hand in hand with my mom to swim on a midsummer night<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"serene, peaceful, touching, absolutely gorgeous indeed.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,Absolutely amazing. Helps keep my stress levels down and puts me in a calm state of mind.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,I think I'm in heaven.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Magnifique interpretation. Parmi les meilleures que j ai eu l occasion d ecouter. Quel talent chez ce jeune pianiste ! C est romantique a souhait ! On reve !<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Beautiful! Is my favorite piano piece<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Dear Cho, this is my favorite interpretation of Clair de Lune.  You've made an already-beautiful piano piece become absolutely ethereal.  Thank you so much for sharing your gift with the world.  I honestly think you'll be regarded as one of the greatest pianists of the 21st century.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,Who in their right mind would not like this??146 thumbs down! !!! No class<U+0001F626><U+FEFF>
Debussy,The best interpretation I have ever heard...plays even the subtle parts (eg 3:07-3:09) with so much precision<U+FEFF>
Debussy,This is the most beautiful rendition out there on youtube.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"The measured poise and staunch discipline with which this man plays this piece is precisely the measure of respect that this music deserves.  Over eager, perhaps too preoccupied with impressing others with their fast playing, musicians rush headlong into the crescendo, fingers flying, with no regard for the listener.  Descending into a deep and muddy quagmire of disjointed noise, their renditions could be mistaken for a metal concert.  This man plays in such a way that every note rings true as intended: Clear, harmonic, concise, purposeful, powerful.  The result is nothing short of a masterfully-executed, faithful reproduction of the masterpiece that Debussy himself imagined.  This is because he played it for himself.  No theater.  No dramatics.  No whimsical hand movements or contorted facial expressions, just fingers on keys.  Well done.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,"와.... 내가 치는 달빛은 달빛이아니라 고작 백열등 빛 수준이였구나.... 
분명 똑같은 곡인데도 어쩜 이렇게 섬세하고 아름답게 들리는 건지...ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ 정말 최고의 횽~~<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,The greatest rendition of Clair I have ever heard. In tears trying to drink my morning coffee. Thank you for this.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Lovely<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"I need somebody to explain me why this piece brings me to tears everytime I hear it... There´s something sublime about it, you can easily dream away involved with its soft and tender rhythm. But please, tell me, in musical terms, what´s behind the sensations Clair de lune arouses.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,"4:47 onwards is how I imagine the good in the human race, the way we can pull together and be complete. Such a feeling of absolute happiness and at the same time a feeling of something uncertain maybe not knowing what is.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,"The song alone makes me very emotional but seeing another human being playing it so elegantly... made me tear up and smile many times throughout the video :) beautiful, thank you!<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,Wanted to learn this piece since I was a kid. Tried today and sloppily made the first 2 pages. Listens to this and now I wonder why i am even playing<U+0001F606><U+0001F606><U+0001F606><U+FEFF>
Debussy,I absolutely am in love with when the first low low octaves are introduced followed be high descending notes - it’s gorgeous<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"I really acknowledge the amount of time and expression he put into this piece. Each note is played so delicately, absolutely beautiful<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,"Moonlight

Your soul is a select landscape fair
Where charming masqueraders and bergamaskers go
Playing the lute and dancing and almost
Sad beneath their fantastic disguises.

All sing in a minor key
Of victorious love and the opportune life,
They do not seem to believe in their happiness
And their song mingles with the moonlight,

With the still moonlight, sad and beautiful,
Which gives the birds to dream in the trees 
And makes the fountain sprays sob in ecstasy, 
The tall, slender fountain sprays among the marble statues.

 Paul Verlaine<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,Superb !!!<U+FEFF>
Debussy,dang he doesnt use the soft pedal wowowowowow<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Beautiful performance of Debussy's masterpiece. Cho puts so much care into each note, taking the listener on a fantastic journey filled with emotion.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,You have my favorite opening. I feel it more from you than the original on the low.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,I would definitely have to say that this is the most calm I have heard this piece. Absolutely beautiful interpretation. Wonderful arpeggios and it takes a certain type of musicianship to be able to play that piece as calming and peaceful as you did. Amazing<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"two notes into this song, and I am already fighting back tears. This song is one of the most beautiful, most powerful songs I have ever heard. This man's rendition is absolutely excellent. Spot on!<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,if anyone plays this for me they will instantly have my soul this is beautiful<U+FEFF>
Debussy,This is my favorite piece and I've heard many versions but this is probably the best<U+FEFF>
Debussy,the voicing is absolutely outstanding<U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D> it’s like you are not even trying<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Sobbing because it's the most brilliant rendition I have ever heard.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Seong - Jin Cho,s exquisite performance gives me comfort and solace , and heals my tired mind and sorrow , and melts away my suffering and lamentation and anxiety , and purifies my stagnant soul .<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,Like a summer breeze ..gentle ...soft .... warm .... Cho Seong-Jin plays so delicately you can almost reach out and touch the notes as the pass by ... beautiful<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Pure bliss. One of my favourite renditions of this piece.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Currently 12:43 and i am now looking at my lamp as if it was the moon giving light because the moon is on the opposite side of my house so i cant look out my window to see it so i have to pretend the lamp is my moon<U+0001F61E><U+FEFF>
Debussy,This gives me new faith in youtube. if only everything we see on this platform<U+00A0>and in life had the same effect.  WOW.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Its like water  poured into his hands and running through his fingers<U+FEFF>
Debussy,필요이상으로 섬세해서 유약하게까지 들릴지경이네..프랑스유학후부터 음악이 더 날카로와졌다고 느꼈는데  지금은 그 경지를 초월해서 약간 범우주적인느낌이다ㅠㅠ<U+FEFF>
Debussy,He takes all of the darkness of the night out of it; his interpretation sounds as though it was meant for a beautiful Spring day<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Great song. Love and peace from the United States.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"It's just like you sitting on a chair, in a beautiful forest full of colourful flower while hearing him playing this song<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,thanks for putting me in such a peace. This is the best interpretation of the beautiful music. I will be listening to your music on my last day here pondering what my life has been. You just made such an ugly world so beautiful.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"This is sublime! Watch his hands, they barely move. Total immersion into the music.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,It sounds as if he was drawing moon lights using piano... I feel like  I could see the reflection on the surface of the water with my eyes closed...<U+FEFF>
Debussy,So delicate...so fluid...gorgeous <3<U+FEFF>
Debussy,This is definitely one of the most beautiful renditions of this piece I ever heard. He plays it so beautifully.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Impressionnant, sous le charme.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,So beautiful! Debussy Clair de Lune was my mother's favorite.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,I always thought perfection wasn't of this world. I was wrong.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Clair De Lune nothing but perfection because you can interpret many instances where this piece can fit a story. Fast and slow, soft and heavy, this piece tells a story that I love to be a part of. This interpretation of such a masterful piece of work makes a more worthy connection that goes deeper than the pieces origin. The title Clair De Lune meaning Moonlight, adds a perfect description of how I interpret this piece. With moonlight meaning a calm night of clear skies and a time of peace as those under its light sleep, so I do I as I listen deeply to this performance.  Just as you begin to sleep, then comes a change in tempo of the piece and so does the dynamic to accompany it. Bringing a yin and yang balance to the art that is this musical performance as moonlight brings peace to the night.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,Soy pianista y ahora mismo estey estudiando esa misma cancion asi que solopuede llegar a decierte un adajetivo para lo que has echo espectacular<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Oh, no! This is fantastic! He plays far better than I do. I need to practise more.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,"I am a professional pianist and have written a Neo-Impressionist piece inspired by Kaleidoscopes. It has been likened to a mixture of Debussy and Philip Glass. If you’re reading this, I’d love to hear your opinion! 
Just click on my name and it’s on my homepage, alternatively search “Luke Faulkner - Kaleidoscope”
Thanks for reading :)<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,How could anyone give this a thumbs down? Breathtaking.  Bravo.  What talent.   <U+0001F60D><U+FEFF>
Debussy,Chapeau bas!!! Magnifaique!!!<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Godzilla: king of the monsters (05/19/2019)<U+FEFF>

Debussy,"Je ne m’y connais vraiment pas mais tous ce que je sais c’est que quand tu joue tu y mais tout ton coeur, c’est vraiment beau, splendide enfin je n’ai personnellement aucun mot pour d’ecrire la sensation que tu nous fais ressentir continue ainsi.

All I can say is that's flawless<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,It bring me back memory that i dont have <U+0001F622><U+FEFF>
Debussy,"As River flows, So Music  plays ~<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,this is how it's supposed to be done. the timing of every note has to come from the heart not the page<U+FEFF>
Debussy,this is pretty stunning. wow. I can feel tingles in my spine<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Such a beautiful art i'm just grateful to be able to hear such masterpiece<U+FEFF>

Debussy,"Thank you for sharing the most beautiful performance I've ever heard. My mother used to play this, and I could feel her. She would have loved it, too.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,I love listening to the rain background versions of Claire de lune and a lot of nocturnes but this was played so well too and nicely shot<U+FEFF>
Debussy,J’Etudie ce magnifique chef-d’œuvre est cela me rend tres heureux bravo pour ce pianiste<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"That was awesome, magical , and all the other superlatives! You out did yourself! XxxxxxAustralia <U+0001F1E6><U+0001F1FA><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F428><U+0001F428><U+0001F428><U+0001F428><U+FEFF>"
Debussy,"Can we get this in lossless quality please?? 
I bought it on Itunes but it is only 290 kbps 
The Steinway sounds 1000x better in person, if you can believe this<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,Your Hands on the piano are like someone who walks on the surface of the water. Amaaaazzzzziiiinnng maaan<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Really amazing !!<U+0001F634><U+FEFF>
Debussy,왜 나는 이 아름다운 선율을 들으며 눈물이 나는것인가..<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Well done! One of my favorite renditions<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Dude has feeling....good play<U+FEFF>
Debussy,<U+0001F525>It’s amazing!<U+0001F525><U+FEFF>
Debussy,I just showed this to my daughter so she could hear the difference between banging out the notes and artistry. Beautiful.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,best version ever.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Cho Seong Jin has probably, among other compositions, recorded the best version of this piece to date. The sound penetrates into you and conjures up memories of your past: moments of pure bliss, heart-wrenching pain and eye-widening hope. Thank you Maestro Cho for bringing us this majesty for our ears; your artistry has changed the way I hear music and I cannot repay you enough. May your sound live on through the ages.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,It fascinates me how much it relaxes me ♪ *<U+A20D><U+FE43><U+A20D>)<U+FF89><U+FEFF>
Debussy,Thanks my dear. You are so amazing.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Seong, bless your heart! This was played at my  Uncle's funeral and I have always wanted to know the song that played there. God bless your heart!!<U+FEFF>"

Debussy,"Simply amazing, thanks.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,oh heard about this Danganronpa v3. So that is name of this song<U+FEFF>
Debussy,I started tearing up. This is the most beautiful song impression I have ever heard.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,I THINK I KNOW THIS SONG BUT WHERE DID I HEAR THIS OMG>:(<U+FEFF>
Debussy,His hands are so charming!<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Both maitre Debussy and maitre Chopin listened from up above to Seong-Jin Cho playing this wonderful work and both responded: I'm out of breath, because this was played breathtakingly beautiful !  And I agree with them !<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,You are great. I am a new supporter. I come from Vi<U+1EC7>t Nam! I play Vietnamese zither. Happy new year <U+0001F3B6><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+0001F3B6><U+0001F495><U+0001F3B6><U+0001F339><U+0001F33A><U+0001F337><U+0001F340><U+0001F3B6><U+FEFF>

Debussy,One of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written -- played with great delicacy and pacing.  Slow pieces like this tend to be more difficult to play well than even the most athletic arrangements as timing is so much more critical.  I would love to hear him tackle Satie...<U+FEFF>
Debussy,M A R A V I L H O S O !    B E L I S S I M O !<U+FEFF>
Debussy,It’s a gorgeous time of my life...<U+FEFF>

Debussy,"Seriously, 98 haters?!  WTF.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,this is just.. wow... my ears have never heard a more beautiful sound<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Amazing played. <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB>Anyone knows where can I download the sheet online?<U+FEFF>
Debussy,I honestly can't express how this made me feel. I've listened to this piece a million times but the way you've played it made me feel everything at once and I - I honestly can't express what I'm feeling right now.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Probably the best performance of that piece that I've ever heard.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Beautiful version, ty so much from Colombia <U+0001F1E8><U+0001F1F4><U+0001F60A><U+FEFF>"

Debussy,Beautifully played.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Isso foi uma das coisas mais lindas e mais bem reproduzidas que eu ja ouvi. E extremamente perceptivel que ele nao esta so tocando de uma maneira mecanica, mas ele parece ser uma extensao energica do que essa musica quer passar. Simplesmente lindo, divino, nao aguentei, chorei aqui. Isso e Deus e forma de onda sonora.<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,BRAVO !!!  Belissima interpretacao.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,One of the best performances of Claire de lune I’ve heard it seen<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"ALWAYS REMEMBER MY MUSIC TEACHER( MRS CHAPPELL, St, JOHNS, BISHOP AUCKLAND) PLAYING THIS MUSIC TO THE CLASS, NEVER FORGOTTEN IT NOR HER.....<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,"One of the best versions I've ever heard, and this is my favorite piece. I'm sure I've heard at least a hundred different versions anyway.<U+FEFF>"

Debussy,"Me encanta ,es mi favorita<U+0001F49E><U+2728><U+FEFF>"
Debussy,I love this version so much! I can't even fully describe the beauty of this.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"You need to cry, with the passions espoused in this ballade, to the deliciously beautiful Clair, of The Moon !<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,"Rain will fall again 
on your smooth pavement, 
a light rain like 
a breath or a step. 
The breeze and the dawn 
will flourish again 
when you return, 
as if beneath your step. 
Between flowers and sills 
the cats will know<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,Oh look! The pianist is going deep into Debussy!<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"Tan bella melodia,que incluso desearia escucharla el ultimo dia de mi existencia  dentro de muuuuchos anos, claro ;)<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,"he has such a light touch yet all pianists will know that that light and delicate touch requires SO much precision, control and strength. it rlly touches my heart to listen to this i feel so at ease and soothed, thank you so much for this :)<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,i love these Asians piano players....<U+FEFF>
Debussy,It’s.... so beautiful thanks a lot<U+FEFF>
Debussy,Perfect in every way! Very peaceful and beautiful.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,I'm frantically trying to copy Cho's style because I'm performing it in Carnegie Hall's recital hall in two days. HELP.<U+FEFF>
Debussy,"superbe version, un bijou<U+FEFF>"
Debussy,Stunning.<U+FEFF>

Debussy,Ooohhhh my God what crappy version was I listening to compared to this?<U+FEFF>
Ravel,The unsung hero here is the guy on the snare drum. It must be very hard to play that rhythm so precisely for 15 minutes straight.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"He doesn't like to use a baton.  He wants the orchestra to watch his hands, not the baton.  He was criticized for his lack of the baton, so he responded to his critics by using this toothpick.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Beautiful. My admiration goes out to the guy on drums. 15 minutes, no break and not one mistake...  Most people don't realize how difficult that is...<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Watch this two or three times and you will know what every instrument in a symphony orchestra sounds like.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Why is that, with so many live performances like this, the person uploading it cuts it off barely a second after the last note?! --What is the desperate rush to end the video? Give time at the end to let the audience applause, then show a wide shot of the orchestra. Let it breath at the end. Why the rush to immediately jump to the next video before the last note has had time to die down?<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,This is the best version I have heard. I think it's brilliant.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"I worked with him many moons ago when I was a young soprano...we did Queen of Spades for the Vara Radio in Hilversum. I had a small but vital role!!! Worked with him and some amazing Russian singers including the beautiful late Dimitri Hvorostovsky, who I adored!!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"12:36 Give this man an award, love his commitment<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Man, can you believe the snare drum player; playing the same set over and over and over without a misstep.  Just amazing!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,the drummer is the hero !<U+FEFF>
Ravel,The ending dissonance of the trombones makes my hairs stand on end. Just incredible composition!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Absolutely extraordinary performance. Full of life and fire. I love the way it was filmed.
BRAVO!!! <U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+2764><U+FEFF>"
Ravel,This is the most exciting piece of classical music I can think of. This great recording shows how each layer of instruments builds to a crescendo. Goosebumps!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"You can't compose a song that has the same melody playing for over fifteen minutes and make it sound good
Maurice Ravel: Hold my beer<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Alright let’s do it again! But this time with passion<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Woman in the audience shouting at Ravel after the debut performance, You must be insane! Ravel replied calmly, She got it right, she understood the piece well.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"I grew up with this song because my mother loved classical music. Oh the emotion is indescribable how beautiful! I am 24 now, they cannot say that young people don't appreciate classic music because it wouldn't have survived so long!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,My late husband bought this for my 18th birthday in 1960. Hearing it brings back many happy memories. Plus it's a gorgeous piece of music<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Very appropriate to start with the toothpick. But he should have switched to progressively larger implements as the piece went on.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,This is Not the original from 1916*<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Einfach wundervoll. Ein Hochgenuss.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Apart from the phenomenal sound I really appreciate the video editing. It builds up same as the music. I was transfixed watching<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"согласен, это лучшая версия ! слушать и смотреть можно часами!!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Proof that size doeasn't matter<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"I'm fascinated by the personality of this conductor - just one look says more than 1,000 words ...<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Friend: bet you can't conduct Valero with only a toothpick.
Gergiev: are facial expressions allowed?
Friend: uhm...
Gergiev: hold my beer.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Beatiful, Imposible not to remember Les uns et les autres, Claude Lelouch et Jorge Donn. Thanks to my parents.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Valery Gergiew is one of a kind. True musical maestro. This bolero puts me in a trans. I'm travelling on a camel in the Sahara desert.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,This is the music that played as the universe was being created.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Ling Ling approves the man on the snare drum.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,No I Drum a little kid 2 me I was given a Talent 4 Music very easy when Natural I do it my sleep only some People !! No Distractions a Trans ! My Grandfather from Russia A Famous Pianist St Pettersburg ! Peter David Melnikoff ! Gave me his talent my Mother side A Gift Ha A Haaaa Born a Beautiful Velocity !

Ravel,"Such a magnificent piece of art, just lovely, and played so grandiosely.<U+00A0> Just beautiful.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"<U+0001F1E6><U+0001F1F7>una vez mas, gracias. Descubri los instrumentos mas la pasion. Solo Arte solo Amor. Gracias eternas.
Voy a contar un poquito de lo mio: vivo en el monte, enfrente esta la manana, cielos y Pacha mama increibles y, cuando suenan ustedes maravillosate aparecen luces muy bonitas y muy diferentes en el cielo.
Es SOLO AMOR que Uds suenen y el video sea ese.
Gracias, lo comparto porque es hermoso desde la vivencia.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,I just love the look on Gergiev's face.  It's like I really do not want to kill another human being who is a member of the orchestra because they get a note wrong in this performance.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,music like this is played from the soul then heart!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"This is a great rendition of a superb song, bravo to the musicians and their conductor...<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Гениальное произведение, гениальное исполнение!!!Браво маэстро!!!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Thrilling!! Inspiring!! The passion!! My God, the beauty!! I can think of very few other pieces of music that make me feel the way Bolero does.  Bravo!!!!!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Drummer! you the real MVP!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"It's like a thought, a problem you have been trying to understand for years. And slowly you finally figure it out, mind blown.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"When I listen to this, I imagine an ever increasing wave of mice marching into battle XD<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,How come i think about suikoden series when i hear this<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"The orchestration here is just genius, Ravel's imagination of timbre is unbelievable. I love when the wind and string combined in the second half. The use of piccolo is genius too, it plays the higher harmonics of the melodic line.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Incredible music, incredible performance. Both maestro and London Orchestra. Thank you youtube for being here.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,A masterpiece of London Symphony Orchestra. Bravo.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Он дережирует зубочисткой?<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"After listening to this beautiful music for 15 minutes, and enjoying the important character that each new instrument adds, how can the last seconds make such a complete & rapturous end? Perfection! <3<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Mighty is the mighty toothpick wielded mightily.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"All anecdotes aside, a fabulous performance. one of my favorites<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"I bought this on vinyl. Found it in an old antique emporium in my small town of Whitchurch , Shropshire. Marvellous <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB><U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Wow I cried when this music was finished... Bravo!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,The classic snare drum part...<U+FEFF>
Ravel,One of the biggest regrets in my life it was that I was born without any kind of musical talent all I can do is love it and appreciate it<U+FEFF>
Ravel,The best bolero performance ever!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,I think the film maker/director should get a shout out too!!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Valery looks drunk, totally hammered, but I love it!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Самый поганый дирижёр, быстрее бы он подох<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"I was half expecting him to switch out for a larger baton at some point. Perhaps even conduct with a series of them as the piece builds, and end with something like a pool cue or baseball bat.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,fantastico....un crescendo da brividi<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Real gangsters use toothpicks. Dude even looks like the godfather.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Absolutely Brilliant, an enchanting  performance. Gergiev, I am lost for words.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,I played the snare drum for Bolero in school. It's a simple part but difficult to play. By the end your arms are worn out.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Wonderful!   And beautifully filmed. Gergiev: a great conductor......<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"This is just perfection.
<U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+FEFF>"
Ravel,WoW..Just WoW<U+FEFF>
Ravel,The relentless march for change. For the Earth. The most beautiful thing. It always makes me cry it's so wonderful.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,The energy build up of Bolero is fascinating. It's motivational. Slow but steady. Gaining energy as it progresses. Shows the power of consistency and persistence. Powerful instrumentals !!!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Wonderful!!
Thank you!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Ever realized that “the drummer boy” and “bolero” have the same drum beat?<U+FEFF>
Ravel,I love the toothpick baton<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Yaaasssssss!!! A most thrilling and satisfying Bolero!!! Percussion A++++!!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"5:38 you can get the saxophone out of the jazz.
But you can't get the Jazz out of the Saxophone! ^^<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"This  song OF  MAURICE Ravel,  is   sow lovely and sweet, so friendly  Thank you  SIR MAURICE , for this MASTERPIECE OF  BOLERO,  GRAZIA <U+2764><U+2764><U+2764><U+FEFF>"

Ravel,"The constant haunting yet upbeat rhythm hypnotizes you as at continues to build to a crescendo, hell I never took music but that is what I feel! WOOOW<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"If you want to experience perfection listen to the London Symphony Orchestra’s performance of Maurice Ravel’s “Bolero”, conducted by Valery Gergiev. It left me breathless.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,At 13:40 is that Mark Zuckerberg on bass?<U+FEFF>
Ravel,2.07 : ouch!! as a fluteplayer this finger hurts just by the way it looks <U+0001F602><U+FEFF>
Ravel,263 people don't have ears<U+FEFF>
Ravel,I felt my self kind of a mediation matador in the arena infront of a raging bull. Come over you beast!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,It is spectulated that the next time he will use a dental flosser rather than the toothpick.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Понять силу и мужество принятого на себя исполнение этой замечательной композиции<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Great music I come to tears evertime! <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FD><U+FEFF>
Ravel,Picture in my mind: The Turanian tumans riding to vanquish the Aquilonian legions once and for all!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Wow... a tooth pick! Totally wonderful.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"In an alternate universe, this would've been a Legend of Zelda concert.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,люблю Равеля<U+FEFF>

Ravel,"I love this song and I want  to dedicate  it to my two  horses who died mysteriously  14 days ago, on the same day. Goodbye  my loved  ones,  rest in peace, you will always  be in  my heart.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,how can you not like that...im vibrating<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Fun Fact: This was the piece that was supposed to be the overworld theme in the Legend of Zelda on the NES, but due to copyright issues, they weren't able to use it. But I can definitely hear how this amazing piece inspired the theme as well as many of the pieces composed for future Zelda games.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,The toothpick player was AMAZING!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,00:00 - 15:49 is the best part.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Listened to this song for 8 hrs blindfolded as part of pledging.  It's a great song the first 8x you hear it, but by the 14th time, not so much.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Love this music! Thank you youtube!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,It's very besitiful <U+0001F603><U+0001F603><U+FEFF>

Humanity will be extinguished ... but this ... will remain there<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,0:19 Those drumsticks look like they got tatoos!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Absolutely A plus  ,It must be his secret toothpick .<U+FEFF>"

Ravel,"La baguette pour diriger whuaaaaaa tellement petite ils sont tous dedans  Musicalement <U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F> AVOZINHA ZITINHA.<U+0001F380>

Ravel,"somehow, I think Ravel would have liked the toothpick ;)<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Digimon, Tank you for letting me know this masterpiece!!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Surely one of the greatest orchestras in the world ,<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,I cannot have enough of this<U+FEFF>
Ravel,This is so relaxing<U+FEFF>
Ravel,The unsung hero; the trumpet who played with the snare drum. He lips must've hurt like hell. (I'm a trumpet player. Also I'm not 100% sure if there was an actual trumpet playing alongside him.) Great song though.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"I love Boulez’s interpretation more, although Gergiev’s account is fine.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,absolute masterpiece a hard one to keep sync and done perfectly. Well done.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Imagine how autotune would totally wreck this piece.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,SIMPLY INTOXICATING!!<U+FEFF>

Ravel,One word: OUTSTANDING!!!!!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"тот момент, когда интересно смотреть и слушать))<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Who will make a new toothpick in world<U+FEFF>
Ravel,It is incredible to know that there are so many people in this world doing evil things and in the same world there are few doing these beautiful works of art. Bravo !!!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,I should add it is mesmerizing and I seem to play it over and over!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,That bassoon solo at 2:03 might be the sexiest sounding one of the bunch<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Using a toothpick! Not pretentious at all. Now, he IS taking the piss.
TBH, and I do mean it, despite all of my knowledge of this genre, I think the conductor was playing the smallest part in this. I salute the man behind the snare drum<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"SUBLIME <U+0001F442>
JE ME LAISSE TRANSPORTER MUSICALMENTE <U+0001F56A><U+0001F50A>

Ravel,Incredible.This is how it's done. Perfection.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"If you haven't listened to it yet, check out the RadioLab podcast Unraveling Bolero.  There's a tragic beauty underlying this piece that gives it more weight (and makes sense of the repetition).<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Absolutly Fantastic!!!!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Tres, tres belle interpretation.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Painstakingly Beautiful performance by the ensemble (Same notes over and over)<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Is he conducting with a toothpick?<U+FEFF>
Ravel,One of the BEST performances of Maurice Ravel's Bolero.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"the drummer didn't just repeat the rhythm for 15 min. he was the other conductor. watch the beat, feel the breathing of the hands, see how the drum lead the piece from whisper to finale.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Megorulok erted te n<U+0151>ci imadom a tested es VELED akarok lenni

Ravel,Bravo my boy!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Я писал не совсем так, но общий смысл сохранился.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,It is great music on all time<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"This rendition of this song is spectacular, the conductor has full control of his orchestra, its a beautiful performance !!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,So beautiful. Every musician is doing his/her best under a great director. Thank you.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Incredible!!!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Anyone here after watching Miss Hammurabi Ep 4?! <U+0001F605><U+0001F64B><U+0001F3FB><U+200D>♀<U+FE0F><U+FEFF>
Ravel,this song makes me randy<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Beautifully played, beautifully conducted, and beautifully filmed.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"I have seen Valery Gergiev conducting operas (I was lucky) , but this rendition is quite well but not  so good.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,he is a madman<U+FEFF>
Ravel,THE CONDUCTOR <U+0001F44F> & THE ORCHESTRA <U+0001F44F> = HAVE ENTERTAINED ME TONIGHT <U+0001F319><U+FEFF>
Ravel,"0:01 | Look very closely. The following expression on the guy's face is not one of anticipation; he's making that face because he knows the conductor fell asleep again. 

XD.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Jack Nicholson directing Bolero with a toothpick. Bravo.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,I did not know Nathan Lane is the concert master of the London Symphony Orchestra.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"RECORD ENDING, FAR TOO ABRUPT.   ALMOST AS BAD AS COITUS INTERRUPTUS. OTHER WISE , ORGASMIC.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"I first heard this in Caveman and couldn't find it until I listened to a composition of the greatest classical music and there it was. Amazing song and I never get bored of it. Helps me work, sleep, play, eat, live!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Gimmicky with the toothpick but leaping lizards... what's the orchestra?
Oh yes, silly me, the London Symphony Orchestra alla toothpick<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,I searched for Bolero perfect version and this came up. I'm not complaining.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,watching a full moon rising with this playing in the background<U+0001F60A><U+0001F64F><U+0001F3FD><U+FEFF>
Ravel,Gergiev is a composer for the ages! Bravo!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"and the weak heads, who have the negative gelikt, I wish only good improvement<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Is this the orchestra that did Rite of Spring. I recognize the bassoonist<U+FEFF>
Ravel,This dude's facials are hilarious. Ya can tell he's really into it.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"I love the way each instrument enters the piece,  and getting a little louder until they all join in.  Pure genius.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"First off, that LOOK he gives to them was like,........LET'S DO THIS!!! It gives me CHILLS up and down your spine and I've always MARVELED at the PRECISION of each and EVERY member of this orchestra!!! No FLAWS, NO MISCUE,.......NOTHING BUT ABSOLUTE PERFECTION!!!

Just great.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Drums dude is so talented wth like damn<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Gergiev, the toothpick conductor <3 :D<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,I was introduced to classical music by bugs bunny.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Credit should also goes to the audio and video recording of the performance. All the instruments are coming through clearly and beautifully. I cannot count how many cameras are operating and then edited into a single video file. Good job!!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"To me this masterpiece consists of the sound of war, orient mystery and adventure.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Найс зубочистка.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"I can't help but thinking of Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean doing their beautiful dance at the Olympics in 1984.   I see them floating, floating ... so gracefully and unmatched since that time!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Очень красивая музыка.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Тостяк башкой трусит ну прям так серьёзно. Скрипач<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Imagine trying to compose music for an orchestra it must take a great understanding of all the instruments , great respect to Ravel<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,This gives me chills.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"How many guys out there had to listen to Bolero for 4 hours straight one night in college? Every time I hear it, I remember that long night. Great times, brothers.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Simply mesmerizing.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,It's command and do..... even with a toothpick Maestro is fantastic in a great symphony by ravel!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"True, majestic splendor, it brings me joy!!!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"So the same thing over and over except the intensity of amplitude increases in such a way as to make it progressively more interesting, fascinating<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Oh this is great simphonia orchestra ,Bolero exellent <U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+2764><U+FEFF>"

Ravel,"and also i think drummer screwed up at the first measure on snare haha... at 00:18 a missed hit... and first and second measure totally unstable...but the whole perform is aaaaah yeah good, it's okey...<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"лайк, кто тоже в поисках русских коментов. Музыка прекрасна<U+FEFF>"

Ravel,"I would love to play this in my orchestra but I don't think it would go over too well when they heard that the song is fifteen minutes of the same melody
oh well<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,From deliciously soft and sweet to brilliantly pulling the walls down in fifteen amazing minutes. Just fantastic!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Class act<U+2757><U+FE0F>Power of  the human working together as one <U+0001F44D><U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Божественная, чарующая музыка ,а МАЭСТРО Гергиев -чародей и маг!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Such a beautiful melody<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Ingeniously!!! 15 minutes absolute bliss!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"That trumpet player is hella good. He sounds more pure than the clarinet and the oboe,which doesn’t often happen.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"It's not the size that matters, it's how you use it. A true statement in many aspects.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,3:04 love that whole part too<U+FEFF>
Ravel,One of the greatest pieces of classical music ever written.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,I was only 10 when 10 came out...i finally get it at 48<U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+FEFF>
Ravel,"It is one of the most beautiful songs of classical music, it is a masterpiece, I love it !!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"OMG 4:02 far violinist Frank Dixion (Stanley Tucci) from The Terminal!!! (Not really, he just looks a lot like him) :P<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"A zene m<U+0171>veszete nem itt kezd<U+0151>dik, hanem itt vegz<U+0151>dik.Csodalatos ahogy atelik a hangszerek M<U+0170>VESZEI.Gralulalok,remek az egesz.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Bolero
E um simbolo de perfeicao.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"je suis capable de l'ecouter dix fois a la suite !!! j'm autres trucs super ,ms dix fois de suite ,non!!!!!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,I'm not going to pretend for a second that I'm some kind of connoisseur or expert in classical music in any way.But this is completely awesome.One of those songs that make me feel feeble and inferior for not being able to play a musical instrument.What a magnificent and epic song.Ravel had a gift and thanks to the london symphony orchestra we are able to experience this today<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Слезы выступили. Без ценное исполнение.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Jad and Robert sent me here.
Radiolab- go listen!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"As on 5-Jan-2019, this piece has been played by SINGAPORE Symphony Orchestra at the Esplanade Concert Hall, with the Prime Minister of the country and his wife among the audience, not forgetting the teen students from the school bands, mesmerized forever by the unison harmony played by all the musicians. Ah, the drummer again.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Каждый раз пересматриваю это видео. Супер!!!!!!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Thank you, Maurice Ravel.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,To me this is Iluvatars creation theme<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Хочется выматерится от восторга, но не смогу. Не получается... Потому что - это прекрасно! Во всех смыслах этого слова.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Wouldn’t like to play a bum note for that conductor ,<U+0001F44A><U+0001F44A><U+FEFF>"
Ravel,It's verry beautiful...!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,I had the Eb Clarinet solo in this song when I played it in college. :)<U+FEFF>
Ravel,I first heard about Ravel's Bolero when I was a child watching M*A*S*H...actually learned about a lot of famous actors as well.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,That guy has the funniest mimic I ever seen<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Molto molto coinvolgente. Gia il Bolero, di per se e un brano fantastico poi con questa Direzione, il Maestro gli da quel qualcosa in piu!!!! Beautiful!!!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,This is the REAL symphonic piece. Every instrument has its own part and importance.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Jack Nicholson as conductor.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Bolero is an inviting piece,  and I have just replaced my # one with this rendition.  God this is complete in it's delivery.  I could do this over again & not find a fault..  Sincerely, worth the time.  Thanks Maurice R.& V.G.<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"I'm not sure what Legion is.
I'm here because this was going to be the theme for The Legend of Zelda.<U+FEFF>"

Ravel,"i dont even listen to orchestra-type music, but this is such a beautiful piece!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,For me this is the best Bolero performance in Youtube!! Sublime<U+2764><U+FE0F><U+FEFF>

Ravel,ГЕНИАЛЬНО!!!!!!!!!!БРАВО  МАЭСТРО!!!БЛАГОДАРЮ ВСЕХ!!!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"The rising intensity,  as the performance progresses, is breath taking<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,This music is beautiful and connects us with something beyond this material plane.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"A great perform by the London Orchestra's, great execution of one of the best Ravel's music, a fantastic Bolero!<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,Bolero is the ultimate crescendo<U+FEFF>
Ravel,"Absolutamente maravilloso, mi alma y las que estan por ahi, agradecidas<U+FEFF>"
Ravel,"Bolero. Les souvenirs dAndorre.

Ravel,AND THEY CUT OFF THE APPLAUSE?!?!?!?!?!?!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Brilliant. Well done to all. Thank you for sharing this.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Joseph Maurice Ravel thank you for this. That's all.......thank you.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Thank you so much indeed!<U+FEFF>
Ravel,Cuanto mas lo escucho mas me gusta.... simplemente maravilloso.<U+FEFF>
Ravel,I feel better every time I watch/listen to this particular performance...<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"00:00 <U+2013> Prelude
01:01 <U+2013> Gavotte
02:11 <U+2013> Musette (Gavotte da capo at 3:27)
04:37 <U+2013> Intermezzo
08:38 <U+2013> Menuet (and Trio at 10:23)
12:19 <U+2013> Gigue<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,Needs more cowbell<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"I grew up on Pollini's recording of the Suite for Piano.  This is a worthy performance.  Boffard is perhaps a little more sensitive than Pollini.  They each bring out different aspects of the Suite. This recording is, for me, a revelation.  I admit I have listened to Pollini for so long that I thought it was 'definitive'.  Now I know it is not.<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,"i can play this, hold my beer<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,"It is amazing to me how this piece has grown on me. When I first heard it many years ago as a teenager, I thought it was impossible to understand much less enjoy. Today I find it not only understandable but completely enjoyable. People whose tastes don't go beyond Stairway to Heaven will probably never learn to appreciate it, but this is one of the real works of genius in the history of music.<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,"For me, nothing sounds academic in this suite; except perhaps the very beginning of he gavotte. Schoenberg applies to the series of 12 notes all the resources of his musical imagiination. I feel this suite easier to listen than say the perfectly tonal op. 9 and its dense contrapunctal effects rendrerd by a chamber orchestra. I would even sat that the pays betxeen a cell and its invesrion sound nice in that context.<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,Weponized music!!!<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,I know this music is not for everyone but I personally find it very compelling.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,Is there any way you could upload the rest of this album? Boffard is spectacular!<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,Great playing!!!<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"The moment at 10:43 with sequence  E,Eb , G sounds very minor to me<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,wonderful to have the score here with the piano performance! Thank you!<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"I can't say I enjoy Schoenberg's early 12-tone works that much - I have various issues with the 12-tone system (other than it doesn't sound good). That generally includes this piece, but I must say that this performance pulls it off surprisingly well. I can't say I'm loving it, but I don't hate it and I'm almost enjoying it.
I will say, I do enjoy Schoenberg's tonal works a lot (that first string quartet!) and some of his later 12-tone works (the concerti).<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,The interesting complexities he did very changing and the 12 tone.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,Thank you for this.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,I love 12 tone music!<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,Amazing performance.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"Hi. Gigue.m33 - m37 excellent structure, sounds human and computer generated. Thank you. ~n8i<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,The Gavotte and Musette are just brilliant.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,This sounds really playful at times because of the rhythm used actually<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"What I like about the Piano Suite--and what makes it easier listening than other piano works of Schoenberg--is the strong rhythmic element, with lively syncopations.<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,I'm in love with the musette...<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,Damn it I'm mad at how great 13:12 sounds for 3 seconds before going back to the rest of the dissonance<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,grandioso el dodecafonismo ¡¡¡<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,I never really liked serialism/shcoenberg until I read it and listened to it at the same time. Unreal craic.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,This music gives me anxiety.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,Outstanding interpretation !<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,It's a mockery of Bach<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"The great thing about this performance is how you hear the influence of Prokofiev (think Vision Fugitives) in Schoenberg's piano orchestration and the differing articulations of different lines. Although the language is very much Schoenberg's, the piano coloring (for lack of a better term)  is much of its time and like a good deal of Prokofiev's piano music, transcends it.<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,the gigue is simply irresistible! all the syncopated rhythms and tritones!! yessss<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,Splendid perfomance! Bravo Florent!<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,音<U+697D>の時聞かされたとき半<U+6570>が俺でも<U+5F3E>けるっていっとったわ<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"Este modo de hacer musica suena siempre (inevitablemente, por mas que se pretenda lo contrario) nervioso y desagradable. Y cuando pretende ser agradable, se queda en frio y aburrido. Solo tiene sentido como forma de transmitir el sinsentido, valga la paradoja. Como banda sonora de un film de misterio o terror, o en ciertas obras cuya naturaleza requiera una estetica feista (dedicadas a la angustia existencial, los horrores de la guerra o los campos de exterminio). Si no es asi, entonces es una broma pesada.

El problema de esta musica no es que exista (puede responder a determinados propositos), es su abuso y su descontextualizacion, y todo porque el iluminao de Schonberg la desarrollo no como un recurso disonante y feo (empleado como tal), sino como un supuesto marco de creacion equivalente a la musica armonica, o incluso como una expansion o superacion, un nuevo horizonte de referencia. Error. Si TODOS los musicos de TODAS las culturas han evitado la disonancia o hecho un uso moderado de ella (y con ciertos fines) es por algo, no por inmovilismo.

El ser humano tiende de forma innata a apreciar y crear formas armonicas. Desear lo contrario es antinatural. Es parecido a lo que hacen comunistas y anarquistas con la democracia: pretenden ir mas alla de la igualdad bien entendida (iguales en dignidad, en oportunidades y en libertad de expresion). Dicen: todos debemos ser exactamente iguales. Quieren crear asi una sociedad mas plena, y lo que se obtiene es una sociedad tiranica (comunismo) o caotica (anarquismo). No entienden que cierta desigualdad es algo natural en la sociedad humana. La democracia llevada al extremo implicaria absurdos como dar la misma importancia a la opinion de asesinar es bueno y a la de asesinar es malo. A veces hay que discriminar.  

Esto se aplica tambien a la musica: uno no deberia atarse a formas rigidas y academicistas que se erigen en guardianas de las esencias , y deberia contemplar todas las posibilidades creativas, pero tampoco deberia negar la existencia de ciertos patrones (no impuestos, sino naturales) de los que emana eso que llamamos musica, distinguible del ruido. 

Bueno, pero en toda musica hay ciertos elementos mas o menos sutiles de atonalidad y disonancia. Ya. Del mismo modo que en toda comida hay mas o menos sal y mas o menos picante. ¿Tu te comerias un chile entero y rebozado en sal?

El musico de vanguardia dice: el topico idealista ha considerado solo una forma particular de belleza femenina, como si las mujeres que no responden a dicho estereotipo no pudieran ser hermosas. Y no le falta razon. Pero, acto seguido, te presenta una gorila maquillada y te dice: esto tambien es belleza femenina, no la aceptas porque eres un retrogrado aferrado al idealismo.

Pero, ¿y la calidad tecnica y compositiva de Schonberg? ¡Es pura maestria matematica! ¡Su musica es un placer por ese motivo!. No. El arte no es conmovedor solo porque sea intelectualmente complejo. El disfrute artistico no es solo el del intelecto. Sera otro tipo de disfrute pero no el propiamente artistico. Un adefesio arquitectonico de Gehry es un monumento feo y hortera al ego de su autor. Una catedral o un edificio del siglo XIX son bellos. Oh, pero fijate en la proeza estructural y de ingenieria del edificio de Gehry. Me da igual. El resultado es aberrante, gratuito y se impone irrespetuosamente a su entorno. Que sea tanto o incluso mas complejo tecnicamente que una catedral me importa un bledo.<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,This sounds like trash.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,Is B-flat or B-natural supposed to represent H?<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"I actually enjoy listening to this. I think it has an interesting sound. I understand the concepts behind this music, but I still listen to it for pleasure and not academically.<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,Thanks I hate it<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,Por un momento escuche una tonalidad :o<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,Delicious!<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,flats and sharps no thanks...<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,I wouldn’t be surprised if this inspired Meshuggah.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,Thanks for uploading this.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,This work is genius<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"So I have a belief that every piece of music has an underlying tonal centre, so I want to try this out here. 
For the prelude, I concluded that the piece ends in the key of C. I determined that by trying out different bass notes with the fifths to hear which one sounded most resolved, and so the key of C was the one to my ears. Looking at the score, I tried to analyze why, and I think it's because the low bass notes in the last bar are G's, which seem to act like a dominant pedal note causing the upper notes to harmonically sound in relation to it. 
This makes sense to me, but I'm curious to what others think, is there any problems in my approach and why?<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,Does anybody know the meaning of those markings in the last movement? I've never seen those before<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,0:01<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"Isn't it funny that when people don't understand a piece of music, it becomes automatically trash, degenerated, painful, worthless, waste of time, and so on and so forth...? Nice comments, by the way<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,"Super difficult serialist piece on YouTube has 132K views? There's hope for humanity, yet!<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,Saaaammmmmmeee<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,Lovely!<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,NICE!<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,This may be my favorite atonal piece. However I'm still trying to appreciate them more.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,It's funny but similar to the description I'm investigating the similarities of Schoenberg and Bach.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,What the hell am I listening to<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,12:35? So much for serialism?<U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+FEFF>
Schonberg,I was trained that the entirely complete twelve tone piece was the piece that came after this The Woodwind Quintet. This piece was his Swan Song from tonality. Nevertheless the journey from Opus 1 forward to opus 25 was totally amazing as well as organic. Everyone should try this trip through his entire opus' and witness how his language logically developed unlike his successors. Whoops did they all forget he was the creator of this concept. He was so nice not to make it too complicated however the result was too complicated for the  listeners to understand.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,I get annoyed when people dont think of this as a good piece just beccause its not relaxing.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"hmm, guess I'm more of a debussy guy. is he still an example of modern music? I wanted to appreciate more than just Chopin (such a fan of him), but this just isn't making it for me.<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,08:38<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,I composed works like this when I got a piano and couldn't play. unfortunatly there was noone to write it down lol<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"The entire 12 tone movement was not meant to destroy harmony but the latter crowd of Babbitt, Stockhausen, and Boulez reached this hideous goal. Now we composers are returning to the creator of the theory finding that he never was unharmonic.  Shouldn't the people who adapted Schoenberg attempt to further his sound still keeping their own personality. Schonberg often divided his 12 tone row into two sixpack modes.<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,"Grows on you with repeated listenings, especially if you also (attempt to) play it. Schoenberg's<U+00A0>goal was the emancipation of the dissonance, and as such, calling him an atonal composer is totally backwards.<U+00A0>He set out to exploit all of the possibilities in the tonal system, even the disturbing and jarring ones, and to use<U+00A0>what he<U+00A0>discovered in the service of his compositions. The abandonment of scales is a nonissue, because he develops a new vocabulary for each piece.<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,This is not music that makes you humming a melody theme or even tune that gives you anything but killing time and listen that someone may play the piano very well.  I instead stick to Hungarian Rhapsodies by Liszt or Shostakovich piano concertos.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,Kinda sad that this guy went from writing Transfigured Night to this.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"This is not atonal at all, it sounds great!! I don't know what people are on about, there are Brahmsian melodies and Bachian polyphony everywhere, it's beautiful! :)<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,who is the pianist?<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,The undeserved reputation is also th use of old forms to support an entirely new language.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,The poster over estimated the influence of the performer. Read the sheet music and hit the right keys in the right order and if it's well composed it will be fine.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"A disregard for traditional music forms, basically freedom for the artist.<U+FEFF>"
Schonberg,The Mirror must be patting himself on the back for enjoying such nonsense.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,Called degenerate music for a reason.<U+FEFF>
Schonberg,"Well, this is garbage. :)<U+FEFF>"
Ives,I love this version ... I think its deeper in feelings then the original.<U+FEFF>
Ives,I search this version without horn for long time!<U+FEFF>
Ives,"I LOVED The Unanswered Question. I didn't like the answer so much.

-Hans Zimmer<U+FEFF>"
Ives,Wow. Thanks for creating and posting this version.<U+FEFF>
Ives,"Thank you for putting this together, I enjoyed listening to it. I treasure the original composition and find some of the criticism here bizarre. Nothing wrong with spending time with a part of the whole, such as during oral sex. I suppose the critics here have never admired a single figure in a painting outside of the context of the entire work. Fear not, there's still time.<U+FEFF>"
Ives,"I like Ives' original, but this is also beautiful. Ives was a genius and there is nothing wrong with taking a beautiful part of one of his pieces and listening to it.<U+FEFF>"
Ives,"I just loved this. I loved the point of the original piece, but most certainly dissonances aren't for everyone. Yes, it obbliterates the core of music of this period, but so would be adding jazz drums and bass to Bach's music, and in any case there's no need to pull tantrums, it's just some people's tastes.<U+FEFF>"
Ives,I believe it's a picture of Earth from a satellite far far away and the Earth just so happened to be caught in a ray of sunlight<U+FEFF>
Ives,"Where did you find the picture you used at the start?? It's beautiful.
And thanks for this, it's beautiful :)<U+FEFF>"
Ives,"This is merely nice, denuding the music of that all important 'other' that makes it not merely nice music, but great music.  I don't care what you do with recordings, cut out the first three notes, but don't call it Charles Ives, because this isn't what he wanted.  It's what you want.  <U+FEFF>"
Ives,"A unique, intense effect that's a simplification of the original, but it works remarkably well. Like all texts this one is out in the world in with a life of its own.  Eliminating the 'answers' does not harm the piece (possibly no one now knows what the final form was supposed to be, if there was one- Ives kept changing it). This makes me think of the a single, lonely being uttering its unique aloneness, perhaps before there were any busy little beings. Your creative instincts were dead on DWXII<U+FEFF>"
Ives,I also prefer this version. No dissonances needed!<U+FEFF>
Ives,You deleted the question<U+FEFF>
Ives,"spartan117q13 
I do not agree. The different instruments is indeed the original but without the instruments this piece of art is much more relax to listen to. I prefer this version. <U+FEFF>"
Ives,"The strings definitely convey the tremendous magnitude and eteranl nature of existence (in a more cosmic sense) and our insignificance. Charles ives original piece is a work of genius but sometimes its nice to listen to just the strings as it can help one feel better about life and look at its vastness and our tiny lives in a more positive light. Its good for the mind! The original piece is obviously unbelievable, but this is still nice.<U+FEFF>"
Ives,"The point of the original was that the dissonance in life is also there to be ' enjoyed'...The briefness of beauty and peace can be appreciated so much more intense if there is dissonance, upeaval and unrest lurking. Tough this is quite  a nice piece to listen to, the fact that the 'ugly' parts have been removed, also throws out the balance. <U+FEFF>"
Ives,"well the whole point was the different instruments representing different voices so now it's worthless
<U+FEFF>"
Ives,"Ugh. Whoever violated one of the most important (to me, but also the development of Western music as a whole) pieces of the 20th century...well go and listen to Mantovani or light classical if you don't get why the dissonances are there, and the whole point of the piece. That also goes for anyone below saying it's 'nicer' or more 'beautiful' - the whole point of the piece is the three-fold juxtaposition, it's the conflict that's unanswered, it's why it's so moving. Delete that and you're left with no Question, No Answer, just 'The'. Philistines.<U+00A0><U+FEFF>"
Ives,"whats the point? if you just wanna hear that bit, why not just listen to the first section before the trumpet enters? why tamper with a genius work of music?<U+FEFF>"
Ives,I dont like that horn either ... its so unfitting. so my friend - thanks :) this give me chills every time...<U+FEFF>
Ives,I LOVE IT!!!<U+FEFF>
Ives,"I didn't know there was another version other than this! I still love this best. It is spare, haunting, and a direct, humble but challenging question to God. It is the one piece of music I heard over and over in my head as I watched 9/11 unfold.<U+FEFF>"
Ives,"Modifications, edits are very common in classical music.
Tempi, size of forces used are all part of the creative expression of art process.
Leonard Bernstein at the Fall of the Wall Concert, Christmas Day, 1989 changed a few Friedrich Schiller's words in the final chorus for this occasion.
The great composers, Beethoven, Mahler, Bach gave concerts and only conducted segments of an entire work.
This is brilliant what Johan Cappaert did here.
Thank you very much, Johan.
When I was very young I was very interested in classical music.
At that time I loved the music from the Wagner operas.
I didn't care too much for the singing and I was too young and immature to sit through an entire one of his operas.
So, when the opera without words trend began I was elated.
What Johan has done here is made this work more accessable to those just starting in classical music or who know nothing about classical music who would never<U+00A0>

consider listening to Charles Ives.
I just wish those sounds weren't squawking. It's beautiful except for that, was what I heard during my 15 years working at Tower Records Classical.
Some will discover the rest of the piece, possibly read about it and, hopefully, about Charles Ives.
It's like the new genre of video game scoring. It seems to be bringng people to classical music too.<U+00A0>
Possibly because many of these composers are taking from the greats! Lol...
Thank you again, Johan! Brilliant. Beautifully done!<U+FEFF>"
Ives,"Je t'aime, Emma.....................................................................................................................<U+FEFF>"
Ives,"I've done a better version of this strings version......what u do is fuse the original orchestral version with  the version by Tomita, the electronic version brings another dimension to the music, whereas here the uploader is just looping the music and consequently it becomes a bit boring.<U+FEFF>"
Ives,The recent movie about Emily Dickinson A Quiet Passion had this version at the very end of movie.<U+FEFF>
Ives,Hmmmmm.......doesnt quite work somehow.<U+FEFF>

Stravinsky,Don't think I've ever seen a conductor so happy to conduct a piece of Stravinsky... hahahah. And then that cue a 8:47. Hahahahah... XD<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"For people who have no clue as to what the story is it goes like this.  At the shrovtide fair in St. Petersburg a magician brings three puppets to life.  The first is Petrushka the clown, second is the ballerina and third is a moor.  Petrushka loves the ballerina but the ballerina prefers the moor.  They have a big scuffle and they leave the theatre.  The moor kills Petrushka with his scimitar and Petrushka’s ghost haunts both the moor and the magician.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"Incredible trumpet playing. 17:01 - Ballerina's Dance, 17:47 - Waltz (pt 1), 19:22 - Waltz (pt 2)<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,Super-clear conducting and all totally engaged!  Thrilling!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"people complaining about the way the orchestra moves while they play get on my nerves... like, haven't you ever been really into a piece of music?<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,I really enjoy this excellent performance with an engaging conductor.  Excellent recording as well.  I love the way the broad range of dynamics has been captured.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,I love how incredibly excited the orchestra looks. Very high energy performance.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"When a conductor gives a clear down beat and communicates, anything is possible.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"Best trumpets and bassoons, clarinets, oboes, flutes and cor anglais I ever heard playing this piece. Wonderful all round. Captures the joy/tragedy of Petrouchka and the fabulous, exotic,russian, playful, virtuoso orchestration by Stravinsky. Still the most joyous piece in the whole orchestral repertoire.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,special thanks to the recording artists. even when playing this piece I couldn't hear all the layers and single instruments so clearly as it's shown here. mesmerised!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,24:40 Is the best part...<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"6:59 - Diatonic
10:00 - Clarinets (volume up)
13:37 - Piano
20:03 - Strings<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"The very first ballet I conducted at the State Theatre in Pretoria - a hell of an outing for a beginner ballet conductor. Also L'Apres Midi, Spectre de la Rose and Les Sylphides on the same programme. A night to remember. Since then I've probably conducted going on for 800 to 1000 ballet performances. Lost count !<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,i spent 6 years of my life searching for this. i'm 16. that means i spent 3/8 of my life looking for this. THIS is how iconic Stravinsky is. I listened to it once on a sitcom and I've been searching for this ever since.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"a swarm of bees and other gorgeous insects feeding urgently on a great carpet of lavender in flower, in furious harmony, creating a wonderful buzz and hum, with rest times, before renewed assault<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"In my humble opinion I think the RCO is one of the best orchestra's in the world. Not mere technically but also regarding musical coherency and sound, the latter which I find incredible noble and warm...the acoustics of the concert hall alone is one of the finest in the world! Thank you so much for posting this remarkable rendition of this wonderful work of Stravinsky.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"wow , this is the 1st time i have heard this . love it .<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,i love andris Nelsons so much!!!!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"17:01 my favourite trumpet solo, I really like it. If you are a trumpet player I recommend you to learn how to play that beautiful solo<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,i love the violin line at 26:03<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,I really hate those people who hate Stravinsky music. They obviously haven't spent the time listening to it.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,22:14 it´s magic!!!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"love the hand gesture at 24:24.<U+00A0> don't think I've ever seen a conductor do something so cute.<U+00A0> and I also saw him resting the baton in his left hand on the railing, would loved to have seen what his right hand was doing without the baton.<U+00A0> he's quite expressive.<U+00A0> love the frowns.<U+00A0> love the smiles.<U+FEFF>"

Stravinsky,John William's strongest influence.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Beautifully presented! This was my introduction to Classical music in 1970, when rock was at the top, and this just slid in like it was part of the rock party ... thanks for the posting, much enjoyed<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,So wonderful!<U+00A0>Stravinsky's dynamic and lively Petrushka is definitely one of my top favourite classics. I love it!<U+00A0>Great musical art.<U+FEFF>

Stravinsky,A superb interpretation by a great orchestra and conductor! Loved it!!<U+FEFF>

Stravinsky,"I LOVE the sheer joy, especially at the almost-before-the-end part<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,Definitely one of my favorite performances of Petrushka I've heard yet! The conductor is one of my favorite parts of the entire thing. He's so full of energy and it's awesome.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,28:11 my favorite part<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,E magnifico<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,30:45 DAMN that crescendo!!!<U+FEFF>

Stravinsky,Un chef d'oeuvre<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Andris is the best! :)<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,How could anyone give this a thumbs down?  This performance is outstanding<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,The energy the brilliant young Nelsons communicates to the ensemble...simply breathtaking. A perfect Stravinsky machine. The force! The speed! The intonation! What an orchestra!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"I love stravinsky, intervallic harmony awesome.<U+FEFF>"

Stravinsky,play -> 0:00<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"thank you for posting this, Stravinsky's music is what got me into classical when I was younger and has remained my favorite composer since<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,Absolutely brilliant textures!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Clarinets are stage left. Bassoons are stage right. Is that Andris Nelsons' style?<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Stravinsky influenced a whole lot of people from Charlie Parker to Carl Stalling.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,I loved the flautist at 6:00. She is so a wonderfull player..and quite nice..also...<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Love Stravinsky.  First time I heard The Firebird in 1970 it was a Damascus moment for me.  Petrouchka was the 2nd piece I listened to.  Couldn't believe that such music existed.  This is a wonderful rendition.  Ecstasy to have been in the audience.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,11:42 is definitely my favourite part ... Sounds like a Professor Layton soundtrack.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"For my ears and feel one of the most beautiful works ever been written!!! Great interpretion here with an extraordinary orchestra and a brilliant conductor and that in a wonderful recording! 
I have some old vinyls with this ensemble and Neville Marriner and they all are excellent.
Btw: I looove great orchestras like here (six basses and all that...) because of the sheer loudness, energy and power..
Just to mention it: Love the ladies with the flutes.
Thank you for that time of pure bliss!!!
Regards from Berlin
A happy listener<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,STRAVINSKY GEHORT ZU DEN GANZ GROSSEN AUSSERIRDISCH-INNERerDISCHEN KOMPONISTEN: Gratuliere zu dieser Interpretation: Ich klatsche ganz laut mit.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,une tres belle oeuvre de stravinsky<U+00A0><U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,23:00 is such a brilliant pure childish part with that naive melody fully embraced by the orchestra and those echoes on the horns rising up and down at a distance. Gives me the chills everytime.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"envahi par l'emotion , 0:53, Andris Nelson perd le file de la musique... juste magnifique.. on est loin de la version conduit par ce fumiste de Pierrre Boulet ! Magnifique... juste MAGNIFIQUE<U+FEFF>"

Stravinsky,"OH MY.. This is now my favorite  ever!! TEARS . Bernstein was always my fav ,move over Lenny...RIP<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,thank you for the post.  Nelsons is one of my favorite conductors and since I first heard them with Haitink in the 1980s I always thought he Concertgebouw is the beat orchestra.  Happy that Gramophone's panel of critics chose it as the best so i knew i wasn't imagining this.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Magnifique    Ah Quel Grand Compo<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Wonderful performance and great conductor!<U+FEFF>

Stravinsky,Those who've played the piano transcription know this is an insane tempo to ask the pianist to keep up with @ 8:57. Sure enough he falls slightly behind at 9:02.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,7:00<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,This piece has the best orchestration ever?<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Why is the conductor happy to conduct Stravinsky (It's so damn hard to do so)? Also, why do flautists like move so damn much! Just kidding; love Stravinsky, the orchestra, and the conductor.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,Fantastic<U+FEFF>

Great music though!<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,Me gusta  mucho esta melodia una gran orquesta<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Everytime I listen to this I always hear a wind instrument overblow(?) at 4:03 lol I can't unhear it<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Can’t imagine how phenomenal this would be live. Listening via YouTube gave me enough shivers and smiles.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,who's the trumpet player?<U+FEFF>

Stravinsky,Bookmark: Flute cadenza at 5:43<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Russian composers on rhe XX century flew higher than any others: no doubt! Yet the very best far from Stravinsky and Shostakovich was Rachmaninov. Here however is a very exquisite piece of Igor as well as The Firebird.
Nice performance too.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,Wonderful performance of the masterpiece by Stravinsky.... I 've got chills and bumps all over... why ? Go figure. Thank you so much Avrotros and Youtube. You are the sunshine of our lives !!!!!!!<U+FEFF>

Stravinsky,I love this piece so much!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG how wonderful OMG OMG!!!!!!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Very lively and at the same time precise performance of this challenging masterpiece. The orchestra is without doubt one of the five best<U+00A0>in Europe.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,I find the Russian composers far more appealing than the classical European composers.  I find Stravinsky mesmerizing.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Love this interpretation, but that Flute Player is having a seizure!<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,Entendo nada de musica classica. Mas achei a sonoridade e evolucao da musica imprevisivel e variada. Nao fica morgado. Mas a quebra de ritmo talvez n seja tao boa. De td forma se compensa pela variacao. Lembra desenhos animados.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Who is the pianist?<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,wow! what a awesome!!! it's really~!~!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,My classmates and teacher love petrouchka<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,first four bars = looking down four times. Every bar. Funny?<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,7:00 good part<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,the contra bassoon at 5:15 and 5:23 gets me laughing every time hahaha <U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Wie viele der Orchestermitglieder sind, Ihrer Meinung nach, niederlandisch? :)<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,That is really interesting! I had no idea!! thanx for the info :). And this does sound beautiful! a little intimidating for me because I will be performing this with an orchestra in the 26th of October. Scary yet exciting<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Yes man, Ton Koopman is happier than him.<U+FEFF>"

Stravinsky,"A Dutch Orchestra/Conductor :) 
Fair play to them :)<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,This so good :)  !<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Sehr lebhafte und zugleich prazise Auffuhrung dieses anspruchsvollen Meisterwerkes. Das Orchester ist zweifellos eines der funf besten Europas.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Conductor looks like a chubby Michael Sheen.
Love this piece.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,This guy's gonna be the new bso conductor!!!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"I agree. For someone who has heard other interpretations this is abit lukewarm. NOT BAD, but it doesn't have that electric pulse that is so...STRAVINSKIAN. I first heard this (as a kid) from a CBS recording with Stravinsky himself conducting. But I wouldn't call it sloppy. Peace:)<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,This is an exuberantly joyful piece!!  It's about puppets/dolls that came alive! :)<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Sloppy playing or sloppy conducting? Compared to Boulez and Cleveland this is a disaster indeed....<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,I am glad you and others like it. Being in minority does not mean I am wrong.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,I and an overwhelming majority of viewers like it very much.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,HELL YES this guy's the next BSO music director!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Conductor hardly looks up from score. Orchestra hardly looks at conductor.... Quite an uninteresting performance....<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,bravo!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Tony from South Philadelphia thinks this version is just AWSOME!!!! Go PO!!
<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,Just thinking that myself. I guess it'll have to be a duel?<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,The best batch yet<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,American?<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Great. Everyone's feeding off the conductor's - and each other's energy.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Nice job concertmaster, but you still killed Dumbledore.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,":) great
<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,Petrouchka and the Psalmns are my favorite Stravinsky's pieces - the Intro of the music  has fantastic rhythmic/harmonic cells (or dare I say motivs). Superb recording here<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Not my favorite Stravinsky work, but definitely the weirdest and out of the blues one. It has its good parts.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,I wouldn't mind taking the second flutist out to dinner!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"You are Right, Just now watched his performance of  Also Sparch Zarasthustra<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,You Mean Gustavo Dudamel<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Sure the orkester /conductor ..contributes to the vivid performance but dont you think the great music is to blame ? As for the dead' - avoid and listen to the Venecual's Youth orkestra even when not conducted by Dada ..(Sorry I dont remember the name)<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,How do you know he's American?<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Giuliano Sommerhalder! He will be at the Vienna Philharmonic one time, I promise.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"this is less psychotic than the piano version
<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"Bartok used tritones heavily as well, the Miraculous Mandarin is awash in them, as is the Shrovetide Fair.  And both Bartok and Stravinsky utilized folk melodies, Roumanian/Magya and Russian respectively.  The use of simple melodies (themes) with polytonality and constantly changing rhythms make the music of both composers special.  The interpretation here is one of the best I've heard.  Bartok's Divertimento for Strings is tritonalism in overdrive.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"Nice rendition !
Thanks<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,You can still be happy even though you don't smile.. A smile just shows that you have energy and time to show your happiness to others!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,":O
<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,i need to explore this further--thank you.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"I get the feeling the conductor wasn't too familiar with the score as he had to look down at his score quite often, more than typical.  Nonetheless, I like his interpretation.  <U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"Yes.  And Tritones also.  The prominence of the tritone interval is prevalent, both melodically and harmonically. This interval is a common one separating melodies of a bitonal nature (Polytonality), and Stravinsky frequently used scales that contain tritones as source material for his melodies.  Stravisnky was THE 20th century's musical genius.  <U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,If you think these guys move when they play check out the Berlin Phil! They gave the rest of the orchestral world permission.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Bloody hell!! Listen to this beatiful music and stop complaning about video registration!! One of the most perfect interpretations for me. Macnifficant!! And don't you see in the mirror every day again. Alway's the same..... Francisco. <U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"One of the best recordings and performances I've heard of Petrushka, absolutely beautiful... Hail Stravinsky!!!<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"of course, in fact look up in wikipedia about the Petrushka chord :D<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,I was talking about the one at @17:07 but that one too sounds great<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,18:20?<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,impresionante<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,this is pretty sloppy<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Not a good video production. Cameras focus on same flute, clarinets and trumpets constantly. They forget the piano, celesta, the harps, percussion and other important soloists. Never saw the cornets either.  But sound is excellent.

<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,are parts of this bi-tonal?  Stravinsky such a genius--voted top composer of the 20th century by Time!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"yes, but this guy is low key compared to 'Mr. Hair and Arms Swinging--Dudemel--now THAT guy really is irritating.  <U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"nearly as atrocious as Nezet-Seguin and Alsop, might I add<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,a face nicely buried in the score. well done to the conductor.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Great conductors don't need to have a score in front of them, this score is easy to memorise.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"Concertgebouw, Amsterdam...<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,Wie heißt die Soloflotistin?<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,The pianist is excellent.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"I concur with rdnz123. i have the full score in front of me- The decending bass figure in question is heard 3 times over a 9 second period. At 7.43 it ends on a low 'e'. The second time, at 7.48 it ends a semitone higher on an 'f'.Then the final time, at 7.52 it ends on an 'e' again.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,How do you know he's American?<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,flawless trumpet solo!!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,I would think that it is safe to say that the podium is this man's favorite place on earth :)<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,19:57<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,13:37<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,10:47<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,But the piano is a half step off of the bass note at 7:47<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,I'm fairly sure that's the contrabassoon playing the correct part...<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,It would seem to be 1947 with fewer woodwind etc.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,The Amsterdam Concertgebouw - has arguably the world's best acoustics.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Tremendous ! I wonder how Stokowski would think about it... I'd spend my whole time watching this conductor ! And Gustavo Nunez..., I'm in love with his bassoon yummy<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"Excellent rendiction !
Thanks a lot<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"Wonderful!  Leaves nothing to be desired, but I'm curious on one point:  Is this the 1911 version or the 1947, which is slightly re-orchestrated for a marginally smaller group?<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,What hall is this? Great performance!!!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Splendide ! la reputation du Concertgebouw n'est pas a refaire; des musiciens au top ! BRAVO !<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,The second trumpet looks like Gordon Ramsay.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,I wish they could have found a way to show the pianist better.  Some shots of his hands would have been nice<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Yes!  Love it!!!!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"I notice that the players in this orchestra move when they play, especially the winds.  It's really nice to see.  It's natural movement too. <U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"What a lively, engaging, HAPPY performance! This is going on my favoriteslisting permanently!  So many orchestral performances these days are so dead and tired.  Not this one.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"Great performance, terrible camera work. Did no one alert the director that whole sections of this work are in effect a concerto for piano and orchestra? Now and then, it'd be nice to see the pianist's fingers. I've played that part and it's NOT even remotely easy!<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,eating my piccolo at 32:22<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,GOSTEI MUITO DESTAS 2 PECAS DE STRAVINSKY; ALIAS  GOSTO DE TUDO QUE FOI COMPOSTO POR STRAVINSKY<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Beautiful !
Thanks<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,The music of my difficult childhood. Love it.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"The conductor's enthusiasm is sweet- like a student- like a kid in a candy store. He conducts rather like I used to ' conduct' to recordings on the stereo when I was a teenager; lots of unecessary gestures that communicate his physical response to the music, if nothing else. But even as a teenager I could have lifted my head from the score for more than half a bar at a time. But, yes- what a score! The ear never tires of it. And the the erruption at 28.34? One of the great moments in music!<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,Giuliano Sommerhalder.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Trumpet player very good. sehr gut!
What's trumpet player name?<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"This music is over 100 years old, and as fresh as the day it was completed. 
Way to go Maestro Stravinsky! Thanks great and truly animated through performance.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,This guy has a permanent smile--like a porpose!---good we need more happy conductors/people in the world!!!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Imagine Tom Hanks as the oboist :)<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Great !<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,We just need good cartoon<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"There was a superior performance of the same orchestra on You Tube a few months ago, but with Maris Jansons. I believed taken from a concert in Japan. Sadly it was removed. Look out for that one! Hopefully someone is going to repost it.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"Quite fun. The conductor keeps his head in the score . .  ?? Maybe, like Bernstein, he wants every performance wants to be one of discovery -- the conductor 'discovers' the piece anew every time. This [youthful] orchestra seems to respond with vigor and freedom. It would be nice if the editing o the video showed a bit more of his conducting.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,Great first trumpet! Funny conductor ;P<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,amazing trumpet slo at 17:09!!!!!!!!!<U+FEFF>

Stravinsky,Whouaou ! la fin on s'y attend pas en vrai<U+FEFF>

Stravinsky,It sounds like they didn't drop the tambourine on the floor at 31:28. Lame<U+FEFF>

Stravinsky,Do Caralho !<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Que du bonheur !<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Does anyone know whether this is the original score or the revised?<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Why is it that some cultures don't appreciate the sheer joy of this? Much better than pounding on people to rap.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,igor<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Listening to this is like being stranded on an island thousand miles off GPS and the only stuff alerts you you're on an unprecedented waters are this composition, truly mystery meets adventure, another brilliant russian composer.<U+FEFF>"

Stravinsky,"I adore Stravinsky.  The moment at 25:00 is GLORIOUS..  When the Bear enters and the crowd scatters,  (at 24:39)...I always laugh.  The layering of different tempos at 25:23 always takes my breath away, and is one of my Top 10 favorite moments in all Classical Music.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,A.ネルソンス。彼の今後が、<U+697D>しみです。<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Fun to watch with my music. Makes it clearer<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"20:57 Afterwards at the shrovetide fair is my favorite part in the whole ballet, its just so uplifting.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"6:27 sounds like the stink of your favorite doll melting on your baseboard heater, and yet you listen. This scares me. I worry that you listen. You listen. I returd. it, the Tard.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,"Brilliant performance, Stravinsky's Petrouchka are spetacular here !<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,I love how they moves while playing this piece... THEY'RE ENJOYING STRAVINSKY'S MUSIC DUH!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,The clariet from 24:42 to 25:12 is kind of mesmerizing me.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"I can't tolerate this damn Conductor, another  exhibitionist like Rattle.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,which version is that?<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,As always stimulating the musical mind and exciting the physical nerve endings. A treat to experience!<U+00A0> Splendid performance!<U+00A0> Bravo!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,That tuba solo was perfection. I could see dancing bear in my mind!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,amazing<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,There was an interview on the radio today with a percussionist about Petrouchka. One of the questions was about its place relative to Firebird and Rite of Spring; the response was that it falls between them. I had been familiar with the Rite of Spring but until now didn't really know about Petrouchka. Happy to have had my attention drawn to it. Thanks for uploading this recording.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"メルヘンチックで、

Stravinsky,"The best orchestra in the world performing Stravinsky with a talented young conductor, already famous in Boston and Leipzig.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,The very first time I heard these notes played by horns (28:40 - 29:12) was in the movie The Wizard of Oz --  I think it is in one of the sequences at the large gate. One of the things that impressed me as a child.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Anyone know who's playing 1st Horn here?<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Conductor is a maniac. Almost a Nazi version. Very dark balance in the opening - powerful rhythms but maybe not enough top-end fizz for this piece. I'm just talking about the beginning.<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,cool<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,17:00<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"Interesting in parts and some melodies, but the whole work is just a vulgar bag of sounds  with no sense.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,Perfect!<U+FEFF>

Stravinsky,"On a scale of 1-10, I give this piece of music AND performance a 20!!!!! Fantastic soloists!!! Infectuous! If Petrouchka is still dancing around his bedroom with his coconut, there is a cure; Ach du lieber, mein schatz, THERE IS !!! Thank you GOD for Stravinsky!!! I'll not sleep tonight! Hand me my coconut poleaze!!!!! Gesundheit!<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,Didn’t anybody else notice that in 6:07 the air conditioning turned the page of Emily Beynon’s music (principal flutist) and she just kept playing? Amazing!<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,Bravo<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,good!!!!!!!!!!<U+FEFF>

Stravinsky,3:41<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"I don't get it, is the piano playing the right part at 0:44?  The version I've been studying the piano is doing the harp/celeste/piano stuff and not the picc/oboe/trumpet melody.  Is there some updated version or something where the piano switches parts?  It's odd to me because in the (maybe) original the piano is out of place for the character of the melody--but that's just an opinion.  Still a brilliant and energetic performance.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,24:40<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,<3<U+FEFF>
Stravinsky,"love that the conductor shows every beat which helped me see the overall structure.<U+00A0> loved the sounds of the instruments.<U+00A0> they each were really full, winds, strings, brass, percussion.<U+00A0>nice balance and interplay. <U+00A0>great performance.<U+FEFF>"

Stravinsky,"The Igor Stravinsky’s ballet for the Ballet Russes was Petrushka: Ballet Burlesque in Four Scenes (Opus 16). The composer dedicated this ballet to his Russian friend, the artist and scenographer Alexandre Benois (1870-1960). Stravinsky worked in the composition while he was traveling in Lausanne, Clarens, Beaudie and Rome (August 1910 <U+2013> May 1911). In the first presentation (43’), the orchestra was conducted by Pierre Monteux (1875-1964), in the Theatre du Chatelet, in Paris (June 13, 1911). This charming and tragic ballet showed the drama of two puppets that a magician brought to life, in a pantomime that became a huge success in all the presentations. Sergey Diaghilev (1972-1929) received designs by Jacques-Emile Blanche (1861-1942), but chosed.to present the ballet with the costumes and scenery by Alexandre Benois (1870-1960). The choreographer was Michel Fokine (Mikhail Mikhailovich Fokin, c. 1880/1-1942), and the most important dancer was Vaslav Nijinsky (1889-1950), that danced au pair with Tamara Platnovna Kasarvina (1885-1978) as a mechanical doll. The Russian dancer Alexandre Orlov was the Moor that killed the lover Petrouchka (Nijinsky). The photo of the charming Kasarvina dressed as a doll, is reproduced (Shead, 1989, page 48). In the second presentation, Nijinsky dressed as Petrouchka posed with I. Stravinsky, and the photo is reproduced (Shead, 1989). Petrouchka was also presented in the north American tour of the Ballets Russes (1916). I loved this presentation of the Concertgebouw Orchestra, but I would like to have more informations about this presentation, for example when, where, etc...

Stravinsky,"Nelsons is enthusiastic enough, and this is bright. There are a few strident horns that you wouldn't notice unless you heard this repeatedly, which I plan to do, as soon as I look up what Stravinsky meant by all of it. 
Don't be a hater. Don't hate people who hate. Try to love them. You don't have to completely love haters but just sometimes like people who hate. That way haters will feel less bad about themselves and maybe hate less.<U+FEFF>"
Stravinsky,First time I listened to this . I'm suprised . I thought Stravinsky would be far more modern  and  difficult . Some of it sounds a bit like old film background music . I know a lot of European lesser kbown composers were draughted into Hollywood so maybe they were influenced by him .<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,What other classical pieces would you love to see performed in this style?<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"Duuu Duuu Du Du Du Di, DU DU DU DI, DI Du Du Du, Di Duuuuu Di Duuuu Di Duur?<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,"1:34 is where the song goes Duuu Duuu Du Du Du Di, DU DU DU DI, DI DU DU DU, Di Duuuuu Di Duuuu Di Duur in case anyone was wondering.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,Reddit brought you here wasn't it?<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Anyone from Reddit??<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,This conductor is a natural storyteller both in his words and facial expressions.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,wtf that conductor is narrating AND conducting like a BOSS<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,This takes me back. The sound of the French horns as the wolf still gives me chills.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,The crying baby in the audience being eaten by the wolf was my favorite part.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Anyone else think the conductor reminds them of Anthony Hopkins?<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"I am 24 and haven't heard peter and the wolf over 10 years.
This performance has played my heart string, making me grin of excitment like an idiot on the bus :)
Thank you all for a well made performance<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,This is by far one of the best masterpieces to teach children to listen to and appreciate music. It gives each instrument a character and purpose. The story is beautiful told through the emotion of each instrument. It is a story told in sound.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"Brings me back to when I was 3, and my parents kept playing me this cassette over and over again<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,Such a charismatic conductor and narrator. Wonderful performance by the VSO as well. Best recording of Peter and the Wolf I know.<U+00A0><U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"I'm using this video for my first graders! We're going to plan a day at the symphony where they get dressed up, bring tickets to class, and watch the video like they're going to see a real performance. I think they'll love it. Wonderful version - I don't think I could narrate and conduct at the same time!<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,"I'm japanese but it was easy to listen to<U+00A0>his English. I had a good time!
Thank you very much!!!!<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,This took me back 30 years to watching the Disney cartoon version of this when I was a kid. What a fantastic narration and a  beautiful production.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,The conductor is such a good narrator!<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Why can't I like this more than once :(<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,My granddad showed me this when I was very small. I remember listening to it for hours on end.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,I really like this...I wore out the record as a child.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,why is there always someone coughing in the background?<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"I'm 18 and play in an amateur symphony orchestra, and this is going to be our last project this academic year. We'll be performing in a school, for students to hear, but for some damn stupid reason my university decided that that exact same day is the PERFECT day for my maths exam. I hate it. 
I really want to join the project because this piece is awesome, but looks like I have to choose the more important thing. Which is that exam that I'd rather have a week earlier.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,I really dont understand why someone wouldnt like this video. Ive been looking for a long time for a performance like that. This is marvelous.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"In the old version of Peter and the wolf Peter's grandpa pulls Peter by the ear, but in the new version Peter gets pulled by the hand<U+FEFF>"

Prokofiev,Such a delightful performance. Those children in the audience are lucky to see it live!<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"Put this on your iPod, or take it from your phone....put your headphones on.  Go for a walk through a shadowy landscape. Interesting, this shall be.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,I'm 41 and I haven't heard that for at least 30 odd years. I remember it like it was yesterday. My parents had it on vinyl back in the day. Great childhood memories :o)<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Someone doesn't like the french...<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,wonderful! Thanks for sharing this! I'm impressed that Tovey could narrate it and conduct at the same time (more or less). His Scots accent for the grandfather was quite funny! very well played. This piece should still be an experience that all kids enjoy.<U+00A0><U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,I always picture Scut Farkas (the bully from A Christmas Story) whenever I hear the wolf's theme.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"Them: bangs loud drum
Conductor: now if you're all relaxed<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,I had this music stuck in my head for decades before learning what it was. I first head it when I was four and it has been stuck in my head since.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"This performance is utterly amazing. The conductor's narration is delightful, and the instruments evoke the story better than almost any performance I've heard before.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,"What's with the flautist's hair <U+00A0>at 3:40 ? It's up in that shot, then down in the next, then up in last.<U+00A0><U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,I actually got goosebumps from some scenes.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"Ms. Christie Reside, you make the loveliest bird!<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,"I only heard this once at school in the 70's in England. I have never forgotten it. Wonderful. I will show this my grandchildren. Two of them have just started to learn the tenor horn and trumpet at school. I am so proud of them. I would have loved to had the chance to learn to play an instrument, but sadly I never that chance. They do. Thank you for this lovely post. x<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,This was weirdly awesome.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,A Christmas Story had the French horns part when Scott Farkus came in! Lol<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Ugly.. Smelly... Why?! I'm a french horn player!!!!!!<U+0001F62D> but it is pretty smelly.<U+FEFF>

Prokofiev,"Fantastic!! The orchestra sounds exactly like the one I know from the cassette I used to listen to when I was young. I LOVED it, such a lovely musical story for children in any country, no matter which language they speak. Cause music is the universal language everybody understands... :)<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,"Delightful! Well executed and extremely funny narration, capturing the essence of the piece.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,many music. so orchestra. such andante con brio<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Used this for my homework.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"I heard this song on one of the Simpsons episodes when santas little helper is wandering around the country, and man i went crazy not knowing what this song was called, not even the Shazam app couldnt tell me (which is really depressing to know) but anywhoo im glad i found it and of course my favorite part of the this piece is Peters Theme :D<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,Every time I hear the wolf portion all I can think of is Scott Farkas from a Christmas Story<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,conductor's narrating and conducting is so funny and exciting looooool<U+FEFF>

Edit: meant dank doodle meme<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,This is a really great rendition! Got to love it!<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"How great is it to share this with kids, I remember laying on the floor of our lounge room and listening to this way too loud and just thinking it was the best thing ever!! A must for kids !!! please send the grumpy old people home<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,The music is outstanding and I loved the narration<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"Oh dear. I don't think I've ever heard the whole piece and the whole story. We didn't have it at home and I'm apparently exactly the generation at which Czech teachers decided to drop Russian music from the curriculum or something (my sister has heard it at school, I haven't - at least not the whole thing and not until much later). This was such a fun performance, thank you for sharing.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,Who on earth takes a baby to an orchestra?<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,finally some action for the timpani<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"This makes me really want to pick up my Clarinet again.

Prokofiev,Y’all came for 1:33 right?<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"This is an excellent performance and recording, and it is fun to watch. I cannot recall when I first started listening to this Prokofiev. This live performance also looks like a rare opportunity for parents to enjoy a bit of culture with their children in a welcome setting. A sort of rare opportunity for children to get some social training under supervision.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,yep guys okay reddit brought us here now lets talk about THE SONG PLEASE THANK<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"Love this. It brings back happy memories of my childhood, and first ever LP at about age 10yrs. Now aged cough years :) .<U+FEFF>"

Prokofiev,I remebered when I listened in this orchestra and the story since 5th grade when I working in subjects<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Who else has to listen to this at school?<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"Wow, takes me back to my childhood.Thank you for uploading this.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,Bramwell Tovey - he should release a recording of famous children's stories. I'd listen to it even if my kids didn't!<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"childhood classic, got my newborn listening and he loves it!!!<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,I do hope you're satisfied with our product.<U+FEFF>

Prokofiev,"Is someone else pissed about the kid crying in the background? Like wtf is the same as in the movie theaters, DONT TAKE CHILDREN IF THEY CANT UNDERSTAND THE THING THEY ARE WATCHING/HEARING AND JUST START CRYING<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,Anyone else from INigga<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,I love how much the music tells the story!!!<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,we watch their s in class today<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"Prokofiev -Pedro e o Lobo, ouco a 30 anos, mas cada vez que ouco sinto como se fosse a primeira vez.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,Fantasic - Prokofiev would have been proud.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"Am I the only person who thinks the conductor sounds like Malcolm McDowell? Also, I came here after watching Blade Runner 2049. I haven't heard this composition anywhere in ages.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,I came here off of a dank doodle meme<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,I'm here because of Blade Runner 2049<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Love this...reminds me of being in elementary school and doing the same performance and I was Peter :)<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"1:38
yeah, that's it<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,"I played the cat in our local theater production of Peter and the Wolf...so blessed...14 years old, best summer of my life...I auditioned did not get the part, but my older sister got the part of a male Russian hunter (she did it all for me)...she talked them into letting me be understudy of Alexis the Cat...well if the actress who was Alexis a college theatre major didn't drop out shortly thereafter...the part was mine. Had big shoes to fill. Omg. I Loved it. It really brought me out of my shell. The music is so haunting and beautiful. Still fascinated. Play it for me please.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,"2:28

Once upon a time....<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,(voice breaking) and with one (makes sad gulping noise)<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Who came here from dank doodle memes<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,I had been lesrning Playlists and i have watched this in class<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"Thank you Sweet Jesus that Bram is gone. The worst conductor the VSO has ever had. It may be impossible to undo the damage and restore this once...serviceable, and dedicated ensemble.  At least cut the Star Wars/Broadway shit out.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,BRAMWELL TOVEY is an absolute legend! I was lucky enough to see him conduct/narrate in the Sydney Opera House. A true genius. His narration was spellbinding!<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,were can I buy a copy of this for my Grandkids<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"I like the end--
the duck, accelerando, faster, faster, faster, faster, then-- whaaa.<U+FEFF>"

Prokofiev,How could anybody dislike such a beautiful masterpiece?<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,The duck kills himself basicly<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"Great, I love it. Once upon a time in elementary shcool my music teacher some times narrated the music as well, I loved to listen to her...<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,1:33  Joi is also represented by the orchestra!!!<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Tovey's narration is awesome.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Lol my mum told me to google this!<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,i love this i use to liston to this in school<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,love it!!! narration is good too!<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"I don't know why I'm always driven to tears by Peter and the Wolf. It is a simple and innocent story. I just can't hold my emotions in when I hear the interactions between the different characters (instruments). My favorite part is that the music tells you who, what, when, where and even how, a scene plays out. The narration is fantastic, but even without it, the choice of instrument, the tempo, intensity and mood of the music is enough to paint the picture in its entirety.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,"I remember going to this symphony when I was 12 years old in 1972 in Vancouver.
Same dialogue, music stimulates your imagination. Smelly french horns and crying kids. Better than rap and whatever the younger generation call it. Close your eyes and open your imagination Hayley.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,Wolf part = best part<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Yooo I remember hearing this is music class I loved it so much<U+FEFF>

Prokofiev,Amazing!<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"This is absolutely amazing, so so beautiful side by side with the story<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,My childhood in a nutshell... beautiful version!! Thank you.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,the best way to tell a story<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"I remember watching this in the cafeteria on a pull down screen, then remember it in AP high school humanities class to name classical music for extra credit...still love it.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,"My Dad gave me this 33rpm record when I was a kid, great memorys, thanks Dad<U+FEFF>"

Prokofiev,I remember when I was 5 years old and I was trying to hear the cuak inside the wolf !!!!<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"Fun fact, Peter's theme was used widely in the new Bladerunner film ( bladerunner 2049)<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,I HAVE HEARD THIS BEFORE<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,I remember this piece from when I was a child - fabulous rendition - loving it!!!<U+FEFF>

Prokofiev,Where all my flute players <U+0001F590><U+0001F3FC><U+FEFF>

Prokofiev,That flute is absolutely beautiful!<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,I like it!!<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,this gives me nostalgia cus we listened to this in elementary school music class <U+0001F602><U+FEFF>

Prokofiev,"I heard this when I was five, and remembered ever since<U+FEFF>"

Prokofiev,I watching this in my music class<U+FEFF>

Prokofiev,I saw this on Clumy's channel<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"Excellent performance and more importantly virtuoso narration by the conductor.<U+00A0>
28 year old child<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,Anyone here from I funny<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,My 3rd grade music teacher would play this record for us.. Fascinating.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Blade Runner 2049<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,I'm using this for my theory class with piano<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Wow! What a great quality video. Using this to introduce my grade 2 and 3 music classes to the instruments of the orchestra. Thank you<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"My dad gave me this album when I was a little girl, and I couldn't get enough of it.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,"Over 50 years ago, I had a record album of this instrumental piece; loved it then and now.- Sounds like the story has been extended.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,I remember this from grade 3. Had to find it<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Absolutely delightful!<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,I couldn't tell if the baby was in the video or if it was real life... and then I realized that I'm in my school library<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Fargo! <U+2764><U+2764><U+2764><U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Dank Doodle Memes anyone?<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"Mercifully, I would have let the wolf going back to the forest. After all, the duck is still alive. No body no crime ... ;)<U+FEFF>"

Fantastic performance though, this is simply wonderful.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,at 14:05 some kids' days were temporarily ruined :)<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"i just randomly remembered about this story. oh my, the wolf always scared me SO much as a child! so great to relive the memories with this video. beautiful music, and great narration! very entertaining <3<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,Blade Runner 2049 brought me here.<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,"That's the real classic, perfect music.<U+FEFF>"
Prokofiev,Vivacious!! Loved it....!!<U+FEFF>
Prokofiev,Did he get that nose from doing that terrible scottish accent in a pub in Glasgow<U+FEFF>
Kodaly,The sweat dripping down his cello says it all. Such an intense piece and played so beautifully.<U+FEFF>
Kodaly,"Beautiful! I love the way you interpret music. It's like you are telling a story. And as a listener (and cellist myself), I adore the way of playing that is like saying That's what the composer meant by writing these notes. Thanks for uploading your Kodaly!<U+FEFF>"
Kodaly,Truly stunning - an absolute masterpiece masterfully played. So excited to start learning this tomorrow!<U+FEFF>
Kodaly,"I love the facial expressions the most, some people think its weird, but once you get into the music, your body control says Adios! :')<U+FEFF>"
Kodaly,"Very different interpretation from that by Janos Starker. <U+00A0>Whereas I like both versions, I find this more alluring for I see sceneries with his playing. <U+00A0>Hats off to Jerome Pernoo. <U+00A0>Bravo!<U+FEFF>"
Kodaly,Tres belle interpretation de ce fantastique monument qu'est la Sonate opus 8 de Kodaly! Bravo monsieur Pernoo! Vous etes tres fort!<U+FEFF>
Kodaly,maravilhoso!!! wonderfull!!!! Awesome!!!<U+FEFF>
Kodaly,A masterful performance - passionate and artistically brilliant! Outstanding in every way!!<U+FEFF>
Kodaly,wow. amazingly beautiful!<U+FEFF>
Kodaly,EXCELENTE!!!<U+FEFF>
Kodaly,Very distinctive interpretation! Interesting....<U+FEFF>
Kodaly,"Hermoso, ¡me encanta! Lastima que a muy pocos les guste la verdadera musica.<U+FEFF>"
Kodaly,"very very beautiful 
I also love violoncelle<U+FEFF>"
Kodaly,"Captivating cellist.  There is a  great wealth here: dynamic range, instrumental palette, light, rhythmic drive, touching and expression.<U+FEFF>"
Kodaly,"This piece is one of the greatest masterwork written for cello. The performance is absolutely perfect. Actually, I'd like to hear the point of view of the seventeen persons who pressed dislike..<U+FEFF>"
Kodaly,≫≫≫≫≫Amo de mais ≪≪≪≪≪<U+FEFF>
Kodaly,Bravo!<U+FEFF>
Kodaly,Great cello peice but if you want to hear it played by someone who has real talent listen to Sawyer Thomson<U+FEFF>
Varese,"shoutout to the class i'm taking that's forcing me to listen to this, thanks for the nightmares<U+FEFF>"
Varese,This is basically a showcase of ancient YTP.<U+FEFF>
Varese,Really regret taking the class that's making me study this<U+FEFF>
Varese,"if you were walking in the forrest and discovered a lost tape, it would be this.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"when i think of sound, in-particular, electronic sound.
its suppose to be static, objective, not have any emotional kind of association.
the sounds here compiled by varese Edgard
i find it hard to not to be affected or un-consciously my ears and mind judge and automatically find some association to these sounds
maybe its survival based, trying to interpret threats or signs of calm in my environment
its almost like asking if sound can ever be totally objective with no association
the way these sounds are compiled its like going through a range of feelings,
although its just sound<U+FEFF>"
Varese,this makes me think of Pikmin 2's sountrack... some of the cave music in that game is very reminiscent of this XD<U+FEFF>
Varese,J’en suis sure c’est un iluminati<U+FEFF>
Varese,"It would be fun to have the same thing except the visual would be the comments people have made about it panning and zooming in and out, etc..<U+00A0> And we might keep the floating pink and purple beans.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"Hey everyone saying this isn't music: it is! It is Edgard Varese and Le Corbusier's take on music, and it's actually one of the first, if not the first, electronic (synthesized) music. <U+00A0>It's not any less or more music than rock, pop, country, rap, whatever.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,1950's Youtube Poops be like<U+FEFF>
Varese,"1950: this is amazing
2018: this is amazing
3050: this is amazing<U+FEFF>"
Varese,I've heard this described as a visual sketch of sound sequences if that makes any one appreciate it more.<U+00A0><U+FEFF>
Varese,Great stuff<U+FEFF>
Varese,"... this is... interesting I guess? Some neat sounds in there but... how do I put this... it feels completely disjointed... I heard harsh noise more coherent then this x.x
Gives me the same feel like just letting a recorder running for a while, taking the recording and glitching it via data corruption and then listening what I get. Randomness with some neat sounds but without any semblence of structure...
Though, I kinda have the feeling that this is kinda the point.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,Probably sounded different in the acoustic space it was created for (the Phillips Pavilion)<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Thank you, professor Clark, for creating nightmare fuel for me.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,Ci sono anche i Barbapapa<U+FEFF>

Varese,Giygas?<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Could someone explain me the logic behind this work? I'm not bashing it, I'm genuinely interested. Since I didn't get here due to a class as some folks seem to have I guess I have some research to do.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,¡Que genial!<U+FEFF>
Varese,"The origin of drone music, I do believe.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,complot mene par des esprits malsein<U+FEFF>
Varese,have this LP.....a classic..<U+FEFF>
Varese,I was inspired to find this after undergoing an MRI scan at our local hospital!<U+FEFF>
Varese,Le gas qui a cree cette musique il est dans le derangement<U+FEFF>
Varese,I think anyone could actually make this.. i just questioned how far they went to get these horrific sounds<U+FEFF>
Varese,"The radio is broken, it don't work any mooore!<U+FEFF>"

Varese,"a substitute for band made us listen to this once and i think it is so cool it intrigues me 
idk what intrigue means i just wanted to use it 
people kept laughing/crying during the song bc it is funny/scary<U+FEFF>"
Varese,This is like a collab between Kraftwerk and David Lynch.<U+FEFF>
Varese,.__.  :c<U+FEFF>
Varese,that video scared me :c<U+FEFF>
Varese,Musique Concrete<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Will do, thanks for the info!.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"It's called musique concrete, although it has more electronic elements to it than pure musique concrete. Try listening to some more of varese's work.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,That's comparing apples to oranges. <U+FEFF>
Varese,A great number of amazing songs were made on drugs. So..<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Excuse me, but if this is an example of a genre, what is the genre? This is awesome! The sound, I mean, the images are just bleh...

Varese,The very first version of Skrillex....<U+FEFF>
Varese,"What the actual fucking fuck.

I can live with John Cage's 4'33, but I just can't accept this -_-<U+FEFF>"
Varese,We must admit it after this piece: aliens do live among us<U+FEFF>
Varese,"What you see here is embarrassing. This version of Le poeme electronique was made in 1998 for a Dutch VPRO television documentary Varese in Nederland and was never meant to be publicly available after the documentary was aired.
Someone must have recorded it on VHS and put it on Youtube later, without any credits or sources mentioned. 
It is one of the first attempts to combine the music by Varese with images on the ecrans and the colours in Le Corbusier's scenario after the Philips Pavilion was demolished in 1959, but it is not accurate at all and many elements from Le Corbusier’s so-called ambiances are missing.
Unfortunately, many people think that this is THE Poeme, but it is not.
If you have a teacher who tells you to study this version then obviously, he doesn't know much about the subject.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,...but the first element of music is rhythm.<U+FEFF>
Varese,This piece makes me feel like I'm playing on an Atari conceal.<U+FEFF>
Varese,That a LOL!!! (Y)<U+FEFF>
Varese,It sounds like my 3 year old neice got a hold of my 80s synthesizer<U+FEFF>
Varese,n'importe quoi<U+FEFF>
Varese,4:06 OOOOGGAAAAHHH!!!<U+FEFF>
Varese,This is weird... >.> I may have nightmares about this... >.><U+FEFF>

Varese,I really wish I could have experienced this live.  Very jealous.  Too bad it was never meant to be a permanent structure.<U+FEFF>
Varese,I actually like this.<U+FEFF>
Varese,Ouch<U+FEFF>
Varese,not even close<U+FEFF>
Varese,Edgard Varese because he owns.<U+FEFF>
Varese,Who made this and why<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Beethoven, Bach and Mozard<U+00A0>would be so disappointed.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,@shazgoh haha ya its the first attempt at electronic music <U+FEFF>
Varese,OOOOOOOOOGGGGGGGGGAAAAAAAAAAA OGGGGGGGAAYYYYYYYAEAHHHHHH!<U+FEFF>
Varese,"I was ten years old and I went into this pavillion at the Brusell's World's Fair and they were playing this really weird music and there were some random images that they projected here and there.  The inside was all concrete with slopes and angles.  I left and I thought, I''ll just wait until they have a Youtube video of this nuttiness.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,yeahhh !! the best ....<U+FEFF>
Varese,This isn't music<U+FEFF>
Varese,My first impression is that I am stuck inside an estranged Sci-Fi series and being hurtled through space and time. . .<U+FEFF>
Varese,I still can't get the point of this 'music'. Lol.<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Music-

Sound that is created, manipulated, or utilized by living entities<U+2013>humans in particular<U+2013>and is intended for at least some kind of audience, be it just for the composer(s), or for millions of others.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,....And then acid was invented<U+FEFF>
Varese,I sense an interpretive dance coming<U+FEFF>
Varese,Why is the recording in monaural sound?<U+FEFF>
Varese,So strange .  can't understand<U+FEFF>
Varese,@elysiumx2 HAHAHAHAHAHA that's totally what I said when I listened to this. It's SUPER CREEPY. glad you mentioned The Ring because that's what my mind jumped to aswell. LOL<U+FEFF>
Varese,this is a collection of sounds which dont appear to be linked together. Doesnt fit the category of music imo. More like a test track for a 50s scifi film.<U+FEFF>
Varese,stoned artist. <U+FEFF>
Varese,"This is freaking horrible and I'd probably kill myself if I had to listen to much of it. However, the song makes more sense if you actually research it :/ Just sayin<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"@WHFRhys oh yes, i have heard of stockhausen, i personally like stuff along the lines of autechre and iannis xenakis, but i was just expressing an opinion that most people feel a bit jarred when they listen to something completely new
<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"Yes, yes, yes, all very modern and very socialist!- Basil Fawlty<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"@WHFRhys you have to be relatively openminded to think of this as music, most humans arent open to change, so listening to this is shocking for people who usually only listen to stuff from say, radio<U+FEFF>"
Varese,@WeirdBeardMan yes ma boiiiiiiiiiiiiii<U+FEFF>
Varese,@koklozina Then you have obviously completely missed the point of this and the likes of 4.33.<U+FEFF>
Varese,lol 4:05 almost sounds like mr burns.<U+FEFF>
Varese,:megusta:<U+FEFF>
Varese,Can definitely hear a lot of Pink Floyd and similar artists in here.  What an incredible work!<U+FEFF>
Varese,"man, this is creepy... >_<<U+FEFF>"
Varese,I am listening to this for my music appreciation class. Its interesting but I am having a hard time appreciating it! Ouch! This hurts my ears and maybe my heart a little. Yucky! I won't completely devalue it though. I am sure it touches someone in a less painful way than it did me!<U+FEFF>
Varese,@slimdave2011 you and me both buddy! I just had this crapola called music thrusted upon me by my community college. I think it should be renamed to my broken AM radio<U+FEFF>
Varese,my fart sounds better than this..<U+FEFF>
Varese,We had to listen to this in my Music Appreciation class..... I want all 8:27 of my life back!<U+FEFF>
Varese,"this is farting with no sense of humour, this so called music. this is crap like Schoenberg or Berg crap, arrogant and untalented farts of sound. this is hilarious that this kind of shit has so many supporters, i don't know, because of trend, because of higher comprehension of Music or something like being pure snob.
And there is no poem here, no poetry when combined with soubd, only ambition - or I should state it with capital A - Ambition of creators of this shit.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,i dont really approve of using holocaust photos for shock value but thats just my opinion.<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Hipsters, I you think you guys could comprehend this.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"this is actually kinda cool. dont be so cruel, it was only an experiment pushing forward the revolution that is electronic age. <U+FEFF>"
Varese,@DHAR3070 lmao<U+FEFF>
Varese,I think I may have just had a seizure from being pissed off at why this even got publicity. I had to view this for my music appreciation class for my community college listening log assignment. I am royally disgusted.<U+FEFF>
Varese,2:06 - R2-D2 solo<U+FEFF>
Varese,This video makes me want to stab myself in the neck with a pencil...<U+FEFF>
Varese,BIP X_*   FLOATING EAR *_*<U+FEFF>
Varese,I dont wanna sleep with the lights of anymore after this<U+FEFF>
Varese,"@FZmustacheFZ I don't know, I just felt like commenting on something random.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"@floydhead1491 How do you come up with nerd? I'm genuinely interested. And yeah, I do stereotype. It's quicker. Not to mention that that's really not even that much of a stereotype.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"@fablan6 Hahahaha. Touche. Oh, and the irony of that, what with the sentence's statement and all. Ahhh..<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"@FZmustacheFZ so not only are you an aging nerd, you also like to stereotype.  you care that much about spelling? scuk my dcik you wrtohlses pceie of shit. ;)<U+FEFF>"
Varese,lmao this video is a trip.<U+FEFF>
Varese,"@floydhead1491 nah, I'm not the grammar police, I'm the fucking grammar dictator, bitch. I'll bet you're from the south. You show off that kind of ignorance.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"@RT04290 
Nothing. Done.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"@floydhead1491 a) you're my bitch until you learn to spell you're correctly, and b) learn some respect, you little shit.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,@FZmustacheFZ  a) your still a bitch b) i dont care about your old saggy ass    p.s. your still a bitch<U+FEFF>
Varese,@floydhead1491 boop!<U+FEFF>
Varese,@FZmustacheFZ a) your still a bitch c) i dont care about your old saggy ass.   ps. your a bitch<U+FEFF>
Varese,@floydhead1491 little bitch? a) male; b) 32. hardly qualifies as little..<U+FEFF>
Varese,"@FZmustacheFZ dude, i said relax, you little bitch<U+FEFF>"
Varese,now this is the art<U+FEFF>
Varese,@floydhead1491 may i reiterate: relax. you pretentious beyond belief<U+FEFF>
Varese,"@floydhead1491 a) I have no mustache b) I don't understand your reasoning. I like good music, therefore I'm a creepy fuck? c) If you don't like the music, just leave. Allow people, like me, who actually enjoy it the freedom to listen to it without being annoyed with rude comments. Just because you don't understand something doesn't mean you should show disrespect towards it..<U+FEFF>"
Varese,@FZmustacheFZ you must not be very liked. most creepy fucks with mustaches arent ;)<U+FEFF>
Varese,"@floydhead1491 I'm very relaxed. It's unfortunate that you have the mental capacity of a gold fish, but whatever. Your problem, not mine.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,@FZmustacheFZ relax bro<U+FEFF>
Varese,this shit scares me<U+FEFF>
Varese,"@floydhead1491 Serious about what? My implication that this is good, or my statement that Miley Cyrus is bad? I'm very serious, about both.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,@FZmustacheFZ Wait are you serious?<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Why are some of you so afraid of music? Not to mention, how can you not like this? It's beautiful :)<U+FEFF>"
Varese,@jgil1967 I'm confused by your reasoning. Miley Cyrus plays bad music..<U+FEFF>
Varese,"@Thatguy301 well i don't know if art is really about enjoyng or not, i guess it's about other possible relationships, something deeper, entertainment is more the thing that trys to fullfill your desire of enjoyment...and you say that you know very little about art maybe you should begin for tryng to change that before criticizing something that you simply don´t enjoy<U+FEFF>"
Varese,I feel like I'm trippin' ballz with Stanley Kubrick. <U+FEFF>
Varese,"@Thatguy301 You shouldn't have to think, or put any kind of effort into something to enjoy it? So lazy.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,@Thatguy301 Your face is trash :P<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Dolphinbrain, thank you for posting this.  I had the LP years ago and moving around, it went the way of all things.  I was delighted to hear this wonderful and refreshing work!  For you young 'uns out there, you've no idea how painstaking it was to create a piece of music like this.  Add to that, it says something about the enormous creatvity and plasticity of mind of Varese, that, so late in his career he was still at the cutting edge of music tech (as it was in 1958).  Thanks again!<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"totally agree with rafigno, but taste is like asshole... pe ruanos filhos da puta<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"totally agree with rafigno, but taste is like asshole<U+FEFF>"
Varese,@Thatguy301 this isn't art?? then what is art?? you think you know all that much like to make that kind of statement...i'm a musician...10 years studyng in a conservatory and I know the importance of Varese in the history of music and arts..perhaps you could try to read and listen a little bit more before saying something so emty like..this isn't art..<U+FEFF>
Varese,"@1337grenade
 I can see why... This is terrifying!<U+FEFF>"
Varese,@1337grenade I can see why... This is terrifying!<U+FEFF>
Varese,"well im officially scared shitless. creepiest video out there, congrats varese!<U+FEFF>"
Varese,Oh my god damn. I be studying this in music. I love how I come here and everybodys got something to argue about. It's all very entertaining but  in all honestly this is a whole other thing. If anything we should be discussing what the fuck this means. Does anybody know what the fuck this means? I sure as hell don't. It's interesting but I really  am clueless. How about we at least discuss and argue that one. <U+FEFF>
Varese,"am i the only one who thinks this is a little creepy? im not trolling, just bing honest<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"@Metamusik Dude, you MUST have done a lot of acid to make that post (smile)<U+FEFF>"
Varese,Does this remind anyone else of the soundtrack to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre?<U+FEFF>
Varese,and this was commissioned for a sound-and-light show???huh???<U+FEFF>
Varese,"ow, my ears.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,@Tarck452 hahahahahahaha<U+FEFF>
Varese,"I don't take drugs, so am unable to relate to the comments of those who do, but as to wether or not Varese's 'Poeme' goes hand-in-hand with them I can't say. Frankly, the work goes down rather well after the second Martini [6-parts Bombay Sapphire Gin, 1 part Noilly Prat vermouth, 1 sliver of quarter-inch magnetic tape]. Cheers!<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"I don't know why, but this scares the fuck out of me.  I love it, but damn, dude.  It gives me the heeby-geeebies.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,This is not good<U+FEFF>
Varese,Pretty sure this is gonna give me nightmares<U+FEFF>
Varese,"@Metamusik i know what you mean, but varese is waaaaay beyond commercial radio. it's not like we're talking about some weird math rock band or something like that.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,@Metamusik  I dig your point. Though I have to say I've known some folks to exhibit very high cognitive-functioning on LSD. but Varese? naw man i dont think so...<U+FEFF>
Varese,"One of my friends had to research this video and analyse it...
He never was the same... ever...<U+FEFF>"
Varese,Irreductible<U+FEFF>
Varese,my brain is now f*cked up :)<U+FEFF>
Varese,"@OwrKeeng
Fake how? What I meant is that I have done acid and things do not get easier to do... well... sometimes they do but in general... anyways I was high when I wrote it.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"@spoqbods 

You're such a fake little fuck lol<U+FEFF>"
Varese,I would respect Varese and Le Corbusier even more if they had taken acid to do this... so beautiful...<U+FEFF>
Varese,"This video is a cross between a bad trip, the video from the ring, and the Monty Python animations.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"I'm high as a kite right now, and this video is so trippy<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"ERASERHEAD? Im lLooking for you! Brazil, 27.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"@Timelander4d Youtube doesn't do the piece justice, it's intended to be listened to with a complex audio setup. The original presentation at the World Fair involved 350 speakers, and was quite a feat of audio engineering for its time.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,@Metamusik That's exactly what I think. lol j/k - definitely not dissing this piece. I thoroughly appreciate it. It has earned its' place in history.<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Folks seem to have mixed-up two different questions here: This is obviously music, very influential and ground-breaking music I might add, but this doesn't automatically mean it's good. I might not agree with all the works of Picasso, for example, but claiming that he didn't produce paintings is just plain ridiculous. As to whether this piece is good, I personally think this format is very limiting: it was made as part of an installation. Guernica isn't very impressive as a JPG either.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"@oneriver101 The classic modern definition of music is organized sound, reputedly coined by Edgard Varese, one of the composers of what you just heard. This particular piece obviously fits that definition with ease. The definition can actually be used to categorize far more than you might think at first. Like Cage's classic 3:44, where the only thing truly organized is the time... or even completely random, everyday sound where the organizer is the listener who choose what to focus on.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,@DrMadvillain  This is not noise. This is Edgar Varese.<U+FEFF>
Varese,. . . giygas . . . . . . is that you . . . ?<U+FEFF>
Varese,that´s the original video? can someone tell me where do these images com from?<U+FEFF>
Varese,Not to sound ignorant at all cause I really don't want to seem that way at all.  I don't fully understand how this is music? Can someone explain it to me? Maybe I'm just not understanding this correctly lol can someone explain it to me?<U+FEFF>
Varese,@TrollSturm what is music?<U+FEFF>
Varese,"@hgchjk That's what she said.

I'm sorry; I couldn't resist.
[which, coincidentally, is also...]<U+FEFF>"
Varese,I just wanna know if there's anywhere i could see a good photo of the philips pavillion in it's heyday... INSIDE AND OUT! or at least a good recreation. and was it just under 400 speakers in surround sound or just over?<U+FEFF>
Varese,@Metamusik Just 'cause it took time and effort doesn't mean it's good. Babies take 9 months and I know plenty of idiots.<U+FEFF>
Varese,Thats not what Varese thought.<U+FEFF>
Varese,"compared to modern genres, it's more like noise-music than electronic :D<U+FEFF>"
Varese,what kind of bull*****t is this??????????? the maker and all the people that like it SHOULD DIE!!!!!!!!!<U+FEFF>
Varese,intro translated:<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Philips has designed an automatic device, one that heralds new art with unlimited possibilities, namely the electronic interplay of light, color, image, word and music in the room.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"The 'electronic poem curated by Le Corbusier, Xenakis and his assistant Yean musician Edgard Varese, shows how our increasingly mechanized civilization strives for a new future harmony.
The show consists of the following parts:
creation
mind and matter
from darkness to dawn
gods created by man
thus forging the time civilization
harmony 
and all mankind<U+FEFF>"
Varese,thanks :)<U+FEFF>
Varese,An addition to my earlier comment- yes this is official..the music is by varese but the visual conception is by Corbusier<U+FEFF>
Varese,People were meant to hear it as they walked through phillips pavilion at brussel's world fair in 1958..so this video may not have any official connection per se<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Wow this song is probably the best song I HAVE EVER HEARD! If only music was like this today so that I might have committed suicide to it already.

LONG LIVE CWATS not cwates<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"Sadly the project was influenced somewhat through a disconnect between Le Corbusier and those working for him. In the end, the images were chosen very late in the design while the music was composed over a seven month period.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"Not only that, but it took 7 months to compose!<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"Excuse me, but who made this video? I'm just wandering if it's officially linked to the song or if someone made it  under the influence of it.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,this is an acid trip. an electronic acid trip.<U+FEFF>
Varese,"I don't have a problem with that interpretation. If you judge it from those purely aesthetic standards you could be right. Of course its fascination rests on the event itself as a document of the jet age/cold war period. Kind of like Hendrix's Star Spangled Banner, actually kind of boring in itself and not even close to his best work, but in that time and place had an inescapable meaning.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,Double plus good post.<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Amazing, huh? In 1958.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,This was an exhibit at the Brussels World Fair of 1958. I think it was one of the first multimedia presentations. People walked throught the exhibit and the images were flashed on the walls while the music played. Way better than sitting looking at a computer screen.<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Just go look at ELP doing Pictures at an Exhibition, with Keith Emerson plugging and unplugging cables like an old-time switchboard operator, in the middle of the performance. Kids are just not taught any sense of history anymore.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"Don't expect a video game fed kid with a Flatland sense of history and no work ethic as was practiced back in Varese's day to get this. Also, movies have overdone this (just like with Stravinsky) and so now poor Edgard is reduced to Mystery Science Theater 3000.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"Yeah, that must have blown some minds back then, while others probably came out of the exhibit demanding that Varese and Le Corbusier be arrested.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,Varese came before Stockhausen by about 45 years and nobody was doing this stuff before him. No Varese means no Stockhausen.  I doubt Karlheinz himself would have considered 'the father of electronic music' an under-Stockhausen.<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Hear, hear. Taste does not equal quality. Tracks can excel at certain qualities, and if you know your music you can spot these, even if these qualities doesn't match your personal taste.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"Ah, come on now. As soon as anything gets even the slightest bit more interesting then commercial radio, people always go Oh dude, they must have dropped sooo much acid. Do you have any idea how much work and effort it takes to make these recordings with the gear they had back in the day? You think they dropped acid and then went on to do precision editing with sound generators and tape-loops and shit? Besides, tripping with this soundtrack is asking for trouble.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,This is way too trippy<U+FEFF>
Varese,Who just saw some titties? Raise your hand if you just saw some titties.<U+FEFF>
Varese,lolwut?<U+FEFF>
Varese,Does anyone know where I can find the text at the beginning in English?<U+FEFF>
Varese,This gives me the willies.<U+FEFF>
Varese,Dark Ambient xD!!!<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Magnifico. Un autentico poema. Misterioso y atrayente, aunque no se explicar por que. Quiza eso es lo mejor de todo.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,I disagree. There's only so much intelligent brains can teach us. Uneducated people can teach us much more; if you know what I mean.<U+FEFF>
Varese,"I see what you're saying about musically worthless.

But it's also musically necessary.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"Musically, I think its pretty damn worhtless, but with that said it does have a danm creepy athmoshpere to it. And for that it is good piece of art.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,It´s very amazing :) Somewhen I´m scared :D<U+FEFF>
Varese,"One should not be afraid to be disturbed by this piece.  How could you not?  The whole thing, from the music to the imagery to the presentation at the Expo was designed to evoke the cultural and technological triumphs and horrors of the 20th century.  E.g. the pavilion is stomach-shaped and digests the spectators; and, hello!  Atomic Bomb!

Modern(ist) art cannot and should not be held to classical or Renaissance ideas of beauty.  To do so would be to miss out on some very important lessons.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"dolphinbrain, were the images in the video the original projected images at the 1958 brussel's world's fair?<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"I find more disturbing the pictures.
I encourage you, guys, to listening to the music paying no atention to the images.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"Yes, art is art. But a key to art is that there are many different interpretations of it and many opinions about it. If it were really rubbish then everyone could agree about it. Clearly this isn't the case. Anyway, can you imagine how hard it would have been in 1958 to create all these very different sounds from primitive synths of the time? There was great care and patience put into this! There was no way to just do a piece like this randomly in a few minutes. Pls don't be so quick to judge.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"I've liked this piece especially since I was a little boy, and listened to the LP of Varese. I have a whole story attached to the music...and now that I see the original images I don't feel they have much or anything to do with what I pictured! However, it's very interesting and the video can conjure an entirely different story. Sorry someone thought it was rubbish. I think it was done with care and intention and cannot be thought of as trash, just because it's non-traditional. Just my opinion.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,fuckin disturbing<U+FEFF>
Varese,serious respect<U+FEFF>
Varese,"well of course I can! And that's something a lot of people shud learn.
I don't like HipHop - at all - but I just know, that from a musical point of view there are a lot of good tracks out there... coz these tracks stand out from other shit hip hop tracks and their certain criteria as to why they stand out I can see and appreciate. I dont have to like something to appreciate its nature
That's not paradox
(I guess that's the word you were looking for - not paranoid... paradox)<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"There is a huge difference between not liking things and not respecting it.
I don't LIKE Nine Inch Nails necessarily - but i know their music is good music for some good reasons. I don't like Oasis songs very much - but only because their songs don't offer me anything - but the songs itself are good.
It's all usually way less about this matter of taste than most people think it is.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"but no one cares wot u think. Just because YOU say it's rubbish to you - doesnt mean anything.
I'm not listening to that piece every morning when i get up - but i can see why it is art. 
and you just seem to be ignorant to some things.
What have you brought up as to why this is rubbish other than your own ignorance? - Nothing<U+FEFF>"
Varese,art is art - not wot you think art is!<U+FEFF>
Varese,and you have no effing idea wot on earth you are talking about!<U+FEFF>
Varese,Lol on the images<U+FEFF>
Varese,"no, is becouse you are very closed minded, and very classist<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"i hate wen faggot nazis like you start talking billshit and tray to impose thier ideas over the oter people

if you like to be such a douchebag, please go away

faggot nazi<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"presumptuous? are you talking about you?

lol<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"first of all you where who try to say first what is art and what not

so. just stop defending yourself or go away

i like this and people like you are meking the world everyday smaller and closed<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"i got a brain you know,

and i see the world in a very diferent way,

so

who you think you are to tell me what is art and what not?<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"im bot good at flaming, but your ignorance on the subject is large<U+FEFF>"
Varese,you need to study more abot modernism<U+FEFF>
Varese,"art is not beauty, art is expression<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"no doubt that Expo 58 was brilliant. can u imagine this on the 425 loudspeakers?? man, i wish i was there.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"What a great way to experience something i haven't heard in 40 years.I had a CBS-France LP-series of French electronic composers and this was on one of the sides.Wonderful,thank you for posting ,interesting posts as well.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,Who is this animation? WHI IS THIS ANIMATION?!?! PLEASE SOME ONE TELL ME!!!!!!<U+FEFF>
Varese,"God help me for watching that. Im not sure why, but the ambience was frightening. I think Im going to have nightmares. o_o

I did like it though. It has a really eerie feel to it. :)<U+FEFF>"
Varese,see my previous post for answer.<U+FEFF>
Varese,"no she had not written it when i met her, and we did talk about her book. she was in her early nineties when i met her. the walls of the living room were covered with paintings that varese had made. she told me that painting relaxed him. we also talked about Erik Satie who is a composer that i admire and she and edgar were his friend.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"it is a gorgeous piece of music, although it's beauty may be elusive to some. i once made a visit to louise Varese at her Manhattan apartment and shared a conversation with her about her late husband and their life in the avant garde.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"None of this is crap...music history isn't crap...if anything it's fantastic to mess with your head. 

I'm sure other German electronic bands of most recent years may have taken some inspiration from this kind of stuff. Kraftwerk maybe?<U+FEFF>"
Varese,you have no idea what you are talking about.<U+FEFF>
Varese,"There are naked girls, which is one of the reasons why it is so good.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,"It is artistically interesting, but this is not music to be listened to. So in some sense this is brilliant just because Varese was amongst those first to create the style. So this is brilliant crap of the past, absolute crap in the present. Dont waste your time.<U+FEFF>"
Varese,The present day composer refuses to die!<U+FEFF>
Varese,"is this brilliant crap, or is this crap brilliant?<U+FEFF>"
Varese,awesome but a little frightening for me<U+FEFF>
Varese,"le mec qui a fait sa est completement tares, marteaux, il faut le faire soigne srx<U+FEFF>"

Varese,il s'approche...<U+FEFF>
Varese,I first heard this in music appreciation class. It has always fascinated me in a creepy way. I never knew this kind of technology existed in the 1950s.  I then showed it to two friends. One said the guy was smoking too much weed and the other called it electric crap.<U+FEFF>
Varese,it's about YOU<U+FEFF>
Varese,je suis outree<U+FEFF>
Varese,"Such a striking piece of avant-garde art film. I admit I was already listening to Ata by Xenakis on my stereo instead of the Varese piece but the film in itself is powerful in itself!

"2","Mahler","Who could not like this. <U+00A0>It was also nice in the movie ""Shutter Island"" as part of the soundtrack.<U+FEFF>"
"3","Mahler","beautiful! the first time I heard this piece was a Monzo midi-record (!), made 5-12-2008, do you know if there are earlier records -performances with musical instruments?<U+FEFF>"
"4","Mahler","I first was introduced to this haunting beautiful piece while watching ""Shutter Island"" This Quartet does a breathtaking performance of this piece!!!  Bravo!
 <U+FEFF>"
"5","Mahler","Such beautiful Romantic piece of ART........    ;,)<U+FEFF>"
"6","Mahler","this is post perfection !!<U+FEFF>"
"7","Mahler","Shutter Island<U+FEFF>"
"8","Mahler","Magnifique interpretation... ! <3<U+FEFF>"
"9","Mahler","i am the guy who turns the pages. any questions?<U+FEFF>"
"10","Mahler","My god how can some one dislike this? like silvery wine flowing on a spaceship, a bird of rarest spun metal! <U+FEFF>"
"11","Mahler","ah...there are some musicians behind the mics :-)
<U+FEFF>"
"12","Mahler","I also was introduced to this little gem by the movie, ""Shutter Island"". Now, my world of classical music has me diving into hitherto unknown string quartets! A good performance! Wish I could have been in the front row for this one!<U+FEFF>"
"13","Mahler","9:35 I didn't know Matt LeBlanc played cello. <U+FEFF>"
"14","Mahler","this performance is absolutely incredible! well done, you've perfected one of my favorite pieces, and now I account for about the last 1000 views!<U+FEFF>"
"15","Mahler","Estupendo!! <U+FEFF>"
"16","Mahler","Such a breathtaking, good performers although something happened in the performance,  well live is live always. Bruckner has both a string quintet and quartet if someone didn¢¥t know
<U+FEFF>"
"17","Mahler","Brilliant and heartfelt performance! Thanks for sharing.<U+FEFF>"
"18","Mahler","Magnifico. Gracias.<U+FEFF>"
"19","Mahler","EXQUISITE Performance !  
 Mahler @ age 16 !!!<U+FEFF>"
"20","Mahler","Beautiful.  Simply beautiful.<U+FEFF>"
"21","Mahler","Im 15, and this is actaully my favorite song. I listen to it repeatedly. It is beautiful!<U+FEFF>"
"22","Mahler","Bravo...<U+FEFF>"
"23","Mahler","Everything is perfect, right down to the venue and its backdrop--what a treat to discover this amazing performance on Mahler's 151st birthday!<U+FEFF>"
"24","Mahler","@PianoHero1994 I think it's ironic, because classical music (especially in the late 19th century and early 20th), a lot of composers and pieces wrote pieces which I felt could easily relate to the anxiety and adolescent conflicts. Modern pop and hip hop are so devoid of authenticity and emotion I would think they would make poor outlets for young and troubled minds.<U+FEFF>"
"25","Mahler","Heartbreaking<U+FEFF>"
"26","Mahler","that piano opening always reminds me of ""building steam with a grain of salt"" dj shadow<U+FEFF>"
"27","Mahler","The first time I heard this was from ""Shutter Island"" but it is now one of my favorite pieces!<U+FEFF>"
"28","Mahler","@PianoHero1994i love classical music..im 19. but yah i know what you mean FUCK JUSTIN BIEBER<U+FEFF>"
"29","Mahler","@PianoHero1994 
It's because they allow others to influence them too much.
And doing that they'll only listen to their modern music and not stop to listen to other kinds.
I'm a teen and am proud to enjoy both classical and rock.<U+FEFF>"
"30","Mahler","So beautiful, I have no words. Why is classical music so under appreciated by teens? Honestly hardly any teens listen to music of this level of beauty. Its a real shame. <U+FEFF>"
"31","Mahler","So beautiful!<U+FEFF>"
"32","Mahler","the great thing about classical pieces like this (i also love symphony no.6 by mahler - also very dark and powerful) is that because there are no words, nothing parts you from the music (in my understanding the language of the soul, the feeling). Everyone associates something different with words, and you can never really tell what you feel, there's always a lost part. It feels like a beautiful memory from your lost childhood, like a distant homeland and it's forgotten magical language.
<U+FEFF>"
"33","Mahler","good job<U+FEFF>"
"34","Mahler","<U+627E>Öõ<U+5F88>ÎùÖõ<U+FEFF>"

"38","Mahler","Now we are preparing  CDs ""Piano Quartets by Beethoven, G.Mahler and J.Turina"" and ""Two Great String Quartets by Beethoven No. 4 Op.18, No.4 and String Quartet Op.132"" <U+FEFF>"
"39","Mahler","@FlamencoPuro1 His symphonies are actually incredible. Probably one of the most intimate composers on an orchestral level. The colours and textures and emotions he achieves in his large scale works are ethereal. <U+FEFF>"
"40","Mahler","@superdevan makes you want to give up everything lol. Such a deep piece...<U+FEFF>"
"41","Mahler","û¿æÑñ´£¡<U+FEFF>"
"42","Mahler","Mahler's quartet is such a treasure! I had no idea that he composed music at this level of intimacy.<U+FEFF>"
"43","Mahler","I love the surroundings and atmosphere.... makes this piece all the more wonderful !! Love you Mahler. <U+FEFF>"
"44","Mahler","This is just... Magnificent.
Simply Magnificent.
Best performance of this piece I've ever seen!<U+FEFF>"
"45","Mahler","Thanks!!!!!<U+FEFF>"
"46","Mahler","@Lukecash12  Totally agree, this is by far the most profound and amazing performance of that piece I ever heard, so moving. I have to look up these guys, they are so good<U+FEFF>"

"51","Mahler","yes 15 or 16.
Very deep and full of emotion<U+FEFF>"
"52","Mahler","Same thing here! I was doing Mahler's 8th Symphony (in the choir). A friend of mine and I was watching this and I knew this was Mahler straight away! And whispered to him, this is Mahler! And Leonardo said, ""it's Mahler."" Haha.<U+FEFF>"
"53","Mahler","Wow this is so amazingly played<U+FEFF>"
"54","Mahler","Wowowowowowow is all I can say!!! Why haven't I heard of you guys before! ABSOLUTELY DIVINE!!!<U+FEFF>"
"55","Mahler","I'm the staff accompanist at Providence College, and will be performing this on a student recital.  What a wonderful resource YouTube is!  Great piece, great performance!<U+FEFF>"
"56","Mahler","Amazing performance. Perfect balance of dynamics, no one part dominates, and each rises above the others for a moment or two to interject into the piece.<U+FEFF>"

"59","Strauss","Richard Strauss, a pure genius.....
Wonderful performance by the great<U+00A0>Mischa Maisky and the superb conductor Sawallisch.
Many thanks for posting it.....<U+FEFF>"
"60","Strauss","Glorious account of The Don, Mischa Maisky and Sawallisch are both outstanding. This is the most beautiful and wondrous of Strauss' many tone poems and other orchestral works (with the possible exception of Tod Und Verklarung, and maybe Also Sprach Zarathustra). Extraordinary performances all around. The violist might be a little lacking in personality but otherwise does an excellent job.<U+FEFF>"

"62","Strauss","Fantastic!!!<U+FEFF>"

"73","Strauss","Amazing! Love Strauss x<U+FEFF>"
"74","Strauss","I'm really drawn to the Don--he's such an idealist--and Strauss really captures<U+00A0>his personality in music<U+FEFF>"

"91","Debussy","Dear Jin Cho, this is one of the most beautiful interpretations of Clair de lune I have ever hear. Beautiful phrasing and beautiful choreography of your wrists and hands on the keyboard. Bravo to you.Seymour Bernstein<U+FEFF>"
"92","Debussy","Right now, it is 5:07 am, dark outside, i can here the rain hitting my rooftop and dripping off the roof, and here i am, cozy, in my warm bed and pj¡¯s, listening to this beautifully interpreted piece performed by an amazing pianist. Life could not be more perfect at this moment.<U+FEFF>"
"93","Debussy","This is how I imagine watercolors to sound like<U+FEFF>"
"94","Debussy","He is not playing, he is kissing the keyboard with his fingers!<U+FEFF>"
"95","Debussy","Honestly when I'm on my deathbed (if I make it there) I want this playing so I can let myself go.<U+FEFF>"
"96","Debussy","I have never heard this piece played like this. Its amazing.<U+FEFF>"
"97","Debussy","Exquisite performance played the way I think it was exactly what Debussy had in mind when he wrote it.<U+FEFF>"
"98","Debussy","When there's no audience, when the musician is completely relaxed, when there's enough purity and the ego is out of the way, the most sublime vibrations of the soul manifest themselves. You are God's instrument when you interpret this piece  ...<U+FEFF>"
"99","Debussy","I feel like this song has a lot of emotions it's like a story without words :v pure Art<U+FEFF>"
"100","Debussy","Amazing playing. You had my 6th grade class of 30 students in complete silence and awe<U+FEFF>"
"101","Debussy","Extraordinary...so many pianists bucher this master piece with a soulless performance. Happy to hear someone who truly feel this beautiful music. When you,as a pianist, can imagine the moon playing hide and seek with clouds in a dark night, you fully understand ''clair de lune''.Each note should be an unexpected ray of light through the clouds. There is a kind of chaos in this music, unplanned emotional bursts. And that's why it is very hard to play. It's not about technics, it's about feelings<U+FEFF>"
"102","Debussy","I don't want to sound weird here, but this young man played Clair de lune by making love to it while playing. By the way just one word from me to sum his performance . . . Perfect!<U+FEFF>"
"103","Debussy","This should have millions of views<U+FEFF>"
"104","Debussy","how can anyone dislike this?? T.T<U+FEFF>"

"110","Debussy","superb light touch best piano performance of this I've heard<U+FEFF>"
"111","Debussy","My god that was sob worthy. This has to be the most beautiful pieces ever written for the piano.<U+FEFF>"
"112","Debussy","Everything he plays is brilliant. I¡¯m convinced he¡¯s mastered everything from the romantic era<U+FEFF>"
"113","Debussy","He plays this as if he is inhaling and exhaling moonlight. His performance truly pierces my heart - BRAVO!<U+FEFF>"
"114","Debussy","FINALLY!!! Someone who plays the exquisite Clair De Lune the way my dear mother played it... with depth of emotion... with feeling... with their heart. SO pleased to have found this performance. Much gratitude & a heartfelt thank you.<U+0001F495><U+0001F495><U+0001F495><U+FEFF>"

"118","Debussy","Una vez escuchando a cho quisiera que el tocara todas las obras. Es realmente impresionante.<U+FEFF>"
"119","Debussy","I firmly believe that from now on, this will be the definitive be all and end all recording of this piece, idk how more beautiful and magestic can you get than this, I used to like this piece but not ""love"" it so much because I was never convinced enough, now I am tho, his sound is just on freaking point!!!<U+FEFF>"
"120","Debussy","Wow!  Really gentle and yet charged with a deep power.. Best performance of this tune I've heard without doubt.. So many people rush it, when it's all about the lingering notes :) 
I'm learning it myself at the moment, and now realise, after hearing this, that my attempts are like a noisy fog horn floundering in the dark at sea!  But with this performance of it here, my determination to learn it well  has been infused with a most incredible inspiration. Thank you so much! :)<U+FEFF>"
"121","Debussy","The tenderness of his playing.... I was afraid to exhale for fear of affecting the moment.  A living person is capable of something so stunning, what can't we do?<U+FEFF>"
"122","Debussy","The best interpretation of this work that I have ever heard.<U+FEFF>"
"123","Debussy","Divine. Absolute perfection.<U+FEFF>"
"124","Debussy","Wonderful brought me near tears. What a splendid performance. And Mr. Bernstein is correct, this IS the most  beautiful interpretation of Clair de lune I have ever heard also. Wonderful!<U+FEFF>"
"125","Debussy","he's incredibly lovely...<U+FEFF>"
"126","Debussy","I am speechless. Such a delicate and pensive interpretation of this piece. Beautifully done Seong-jin Cho.<U+FEFF>"
"127","Debussy","This reminds me of my childhood for some reason... walking hand in hand with my mom to swim on a midsummer night<U+FEFF>"
"128","Debussy","serene, peaceful, touching, absolutely gorgeous indeed.<U+FEFF>"
"129","Debussy","Absolutely amazing. Helps keep my stress levels down and puts me in a calm state of mind.<U+FEFF>"
"130","Debussy","I think I'm in heaven.<U+FEFF>"
"131","Debussy","Magnifique interpretation. Parmi les meilleures que j ai eu l occasion d ecouter. Quel talent chez ce jeune pianiste ! C est romantique a souhait ! On reve !<U+FEFF>"
"132","Debussy","Beautiful! Is my favorite piano piece<U+FEFF>"
"133","Debussy","Dear Cho, this is my favorite interpretation of Clair de Lune.  You've made an already-beautiful piano piece become absolutely ethereal.  Thank you so much for sharing your gift with the world.  I honestly think you'll be regarded as one of the greatest pianists of the 21st century.<U+FEFF>"
"134","Debussy","Who in their right mind would not like this??146 thumbs down! !!! No class<U+0001F626><U+FEFF>"
"135","Debussy","The best interpretation I have ever heard...plays even the subtle parts (eg 3:07-3:09) with so much precision<U+FEFF>"
"136","Debussy","This is the most beautiful rendition out there on youtube.<U+FEFF>"
"137","Debussy","The measured poise and staunch discipline with which this man plays this piece is precisely the measure of respect that this music deserves.  Over eager, perhaps too preoccupied with impressing others with their fast playing, musicians rush headlong into the crescendo, fingers flying, with no regard for the listener.  Descending into a deep and muddy quagmire of disjointed noise, their renditions could be mistaken for a metal concert.  This man plays in such a way that every note rings true as intended: Clear, harmonic, concise, purposeful, powerful.  The result is nothing short of a masterfully-executed, faithful reproduction of the masterpiece that Debussy himself imagined.  This is because he played it for himself.  No theater.  No dramatics.  No whimsical hand movements or contorted facial expressions, just fingers on keys.  Well done.<U+FEFF>"
"138","Debussy","¿Í.... ³»°¡ Ä¡´Â ´ÞºûÀº ´ÞºûÀÌ¾Æ´Ï¶ó °íÀÛ ¹é¿­µî ºû ¼öÁØÀÌ¿´±¸³ª....

"140","Debussy","Lovely<U+FEFF>"
"141","Debussy","I need somebody to explain me why this piece brings me to tears everytime I hear it... There¢¥s something sublime about it, you can easily dream away involved with its soft and tender rhythm. But please, tell me, in musical terms, what¢¥s behind the sensations ""Clair de lune"" arouses.<U+FEFF>"
"142","Debussy","4:47 onwards is how I imagine the good in the human race, the way we can pull together and be complete. Such a feeling of absolute happiness and at the same time a feeling of something uncertain maybe not knowing what is.<U+FEFF>"
"143","Debussy","The song alone makes me very emotional but seeing another human being playing it so elegantly... made me tear up and smile many times throughout the video :) beautiful, thank you!<U+FEFF>"
"144","Debussy","Wanted to learn this piece since I was a kid. Tried today and sloppily made the first 2 pages. Listens to this and now I wonder why i am even playing<U+0001F606><U+0001F606><U+0001F606><U+FEFF>"
"145","Debussy","I absolutely am in love with when the first low low octaves are introduced followed be high descending notes - it¡¯s gorgeous<U+FEFF>"
"146","Debussy","I really acknowledge the amount of time and expression he put into this piece. Each note is played so delicately, absolutely beautiful<U+FEFF>"
"147","Debussy","Moonlight

Your soul is a select landscape fair
Where charming masqueraders and bergamaskers go
Playing the lute and dancing and almost
Sad beneath their fantastic disguises.

All sing in a minor key
Of victorious love and the opportune life,
They do not seem to believe in their happiness
And their song mingles with the moonlight,

With the still moonlight, sad and beautiful,
Which gives the birds to dream in the trees 
And makes the fountain sprays sob in ecstasy, 
The tall, slender fountain sprays among the marble statues.

 Paul Verlaine<U+FEFF>"
"148","Debussy","Superb !!!<U+FEFF>"
"149","Debussy","dang he doesnt use the soft pedal wowowowowow<U+FEFF>"
"150","Debussy","Beautiful performance of Debussy's masterpiece. Cho puts so much care into each note, taking the listener on a fantastic journey filled with emotion.<U+FEFF>"
"151","Debussy","You have my favorite opening. I feel it more from you than the original on the low.<U+FEFF>"
"152","Debussy","I would definitely have to say that this is the most calm I have heard this piece. Absolutely beautiful interpretation. Wonderful arpeggios and it takes a certain type of musicianship to be able to play that piece as calming and peaceful as you did. Amazing<U+FEFF>"
"153","Debussy","two notes into this song, and I am already fighting back tears. This song is one of the most beautiful, most powerful songs I have ever heard. This man's rendition is absolutely excellent. Spot on!<U+FEFF>"
"154","Debussy","if anyone plays this for me they will instantly have my soul this is beautiful<U+FEFF>"

"157","Debussy","Sobbing because it's the most brilliant rendition I have ever heard.<U+FEFF>"
"158","Debussy","Seong - Jin Cho,s exquisite performance gives me comfort and solace , and heals my tired mind and sorrow , and melts away my suffering and lamentation and anxiety , and purifies my stagnant soul .<U+FEFF>"
"159","Debussy","Like a summer breeze ..gentle ...soft .... warm .... Cho Seong-Jin plays so delicately you can almost reach out and touch the notes as the pass by ... beautiful<U+FEFF>"
"160","Debussy","Pure bliss. One of my favourite renditions of this piece.<U+FEFF>"
"161","Debussy","Currently 12:43 and i am now looking at my lamp as if it was the moon giving light because the moon is on the opposite side of my house so i cant look out my window to see it so i have to pretend the lamp is my moon<U+0001F61E><U+FEFF>"

"166","Debussy","Great song. Love and peace from the United States.<U+FEFF>"
"167","Debussy","It's just like you sitting on a chair, in a beautiful forest full of colourful flower while hearing him playing this song<U+FEFF>"
"168","Debussy","thanks for putting me in such a peace. This is the best interpretation of the beautiful music. I will be listening to your music on my last day here pondering what my life has been. You just made such an ugly world so beautiful.<U+FEFF>"
"169","Debussy","This is sublime! Watch his hands, they barely move. Total immersion into the music.<U+FEFF>"
"170","Debussy","It sounds as if he was drawing moon lights using piano... I feel like  I could see the reflection on the surface of the water with my eyes closed...<U+FEFF>"
"171","Debussy","So delicate...so fluid...gorgeous <3<U+FEFF>"
"172","Debussy","This is definitely one of the most beautiful renditions of this piece I ever heard. He plays it so beautifully.<U+FEFF>"
"173","Debussy","Impressionnant, sous le charme.<U+FEFF>"
"174","Debussy","So beautiful! Debussy Clair de Lune was my mother's favorite.<U+FEFF>"
"175","Debussy","I always thought perfection wasn't of this world. I was wrong.<U+FEFF>"
"176","Debussy","Clair De Lune nothing but perfection because you can interpret many instances where this piece can fit a story. Fast and slow, soft and heavy, this piece tells a story that I love to be a part of. This interpretation of such a masterful piece of work makes a more worthy connection that goes deeper than the pieces origin. The title Clair De Lune meaning ""Moonlight"", adds a perfect description of how I interpret this piece. With moonlight meaning a calm night of clear skies and a time of peace as those under its light sleep, so I do I as I listen deeply to this performance.  Just as you begin to sleep, then comes a change in tempo of the piece and so does the dynamic to accompany it. Bringing a yin and yang balance to the art that is this musical performance as moonlight brings peace to the night.<U+FEFF>"

"290","Debussy","Ooohhhh my God what crappy version was I listening to compared to this?<U+FEFF>"
"291","Ravel","The unsung hero here is the guy on the snare drum. It must be very hard to play that rhythm so precisely for 15 minutes straight.<U+FEFF>"
"292","Ravel","He doesn't like to use a baton.  He wants the orchestra to watch his hands, not the baton.  He was criticized for his lack of the baton, so he responded to his critics by using this toothpick.<U+FEFF>"
"293","Ravel","Beautiful. My admiration goes out to the guy on drums. 15 minutes, no break and not one mistake...  Most people don't realize how difficult that is...<U+FEFF>"
"294","Ravel","Watch this two or three times and you will know what every instrument in a symphony orchestra sounds like.<U+FEFF>"
"295","Ravel","Why is that, with so many live performances like this, the person uploading it cuts it off barely a second after the last note?! --What is the desperate rush to end the video? Give time at the end to let the audience applause, then show a wide shot of the orchestra. Let it breath at the end. Why the rush to immediately jump to the next video before the last note has had time to die down?<U+FEFF>"
"296","Ravel","This is the best version I have heard. I think it's brilliant.<U+FEFF>"
"297","Ravel","I worked with him many moons ago when I was a young soprano...we did Queen of Spades for the Vara Radio in Hilversum. I had a small but vital role!!! Worked with him and some amazing Russian singers including the beautiful late Dimitri Hvorostovsky, who I adored!!<U+FEFF>"
"298","Ravel","12:36 Give this man an award, love his commitment<U+FEFF>"

"306","Ravel","Woman in the audience shouting at Ravel after the debut performance, ""You must be insane!"" Ravel replied calmly, ""She got it right, she understood the piece well.""<U+FEFF>"
"307","Ravel","I grew up with this song because my mother loved classical music. Oh the emotion is indescribable how beautiful! I am 24 now, they cannot say that young people don't appreciate classic music because it wouldn't have survived so long!<U+FEFF>"
"308","Ravel","My late husband bought this for my 18th birthday in 1960. Hearing it brings back many happy memories. Plus it's a gorgeous piece of music<U+FEFF>"
"309","Ravel","Very appropriate to start with the toothpick. But he should have switched to progressively larger implements as the piece went on.<U+FEFF>"

"332","Ravel","How come i think about suikoden series when i hear this<U+FEFF>"
"333","Ravel","The orchestration here is just genius, Ravel's imagination of timbre is unbelievable. I love when the wind and string combined in the second half. The use of piccolo is genius too, it plays the higher harmonics of the melodic line.<U+FEFF>"

"553","Schonberg","I grew up on Pollini's recording of the Suite for Piano.  This is a worthy performance.  Boffard is perhaps a little more sensitive than Pollini.  They each bring out different aspects of the Suite. This recording is, for me, a revelation.  I admit I have listened to Pollini for so long that I thought it was 'definitive'.  Now I know it is not.<U+FEFF>"
"554","Schonberg","i can play this, hold my beer<U+FEFF>"
"555","Schonberg","It is amazing to me how this piece has grown on me. When I first heard it many years ago as a teenager, I thought it was impossible to understand much less enjoy. Today I find it not only understandable but completely enjoyable. People whose tastes don't go beyond ""Stairway to Heaven"" will probably never learn to appreciate it, but this is one of the real works of genius in the history of music.<U+FEFF>"
"556","Schonberg","For me, nothing sounds academic in this suite; except perhaps the very beginning of he gavotte. Schoenberg applies to the series of 12 notes all the resources of his musical imagiination. I feel this suite easier to listen than say the perfectly tonal op. 9 and its dense contrapunctal effects rendrerd by a chamber orchestra. I would even sat that the pays betxeen a cell and its invesrion sound nice in that context.<U+FEFF>"
"557","Schonberg","Weponized music!!!<U+FEFF>"
"558","Schonberg","I know this music is not for everyone but I personally find it very compelling.<U+FEFF>"
"559","Schonberg","Is there any way you could upload the rest of this album? Boffard is spectacular!<U+FEFF>"
"560","Schonberg","Great playing!!!<U+FEFF>"
"561","Schonberg","The moment at 10:43 with sequence  E,Eb , G sounds very minor to me<U+FEFF>"
"562","Schonberg","wonderful to have the score here with the piano performance! Thank you!<U+FEFF>"
"563","Schonberg","I can't say I enjoy Schoenberg's early 12-tone works that much - I have various issues with the 12-tone system (other than ""it doesn't sound good""). That generally includes this piece, but I must say that this performance pulls it off surprisingly well. I can't say I'm loving it, but I don't hate it and I'm almost enjoying it.
I will say, I do enjoy Schoenberg's tonal works a lot (that first string quartet!) and some of his later 12-tone works (the concerti).<U+FEFF>"
"564","Schonberg","The interesting complexities he did very changing and the 12 tone.<U+FEFF>"
"565","Schonberg","Thank you for this.<U+FEFF>"

"569","Schonberg","The Gavotte and Musette are just brilliant.<U+FEFF>"
"570","Schonberg","This sounds really playful at times because of the rhythm used actually<U+FEFF>"
"571","Schonberg","What I like about the Piano Suite--and what makes it easier listening than other piano works of Schoenberg--is the strong rhythmic element, with lively syncopations.<U+FEFF>"
"572","Schonberg","I'm in love with the musette...<U+FEFF>"
"573","Schonberg","Damn it I'm mad at how great 13:12 sounds for 3 seconds before going back to the rest of the dissonance<U+FEFF>"
"574","Schonberg","grandioso el dodecafonismo ¢®¢®¢®<U+FEFF>"
"575","Schonberg","I never really liked serialism/shcoenberg until I read it and listened to it at the same time. Unreal craic.<U+FEFF>"
"576","Schonberg","This music gives me anxiety.<U+FEFF>"
"577","Schonberg","Outstanding interpretation !<U+FEFF>"
"578","Schonberg","It's a mockery of Bach<U+FEFF>"
"579","Schonberg","The great thing about this performance is how you hear the influence of Prokofiev (think Vision Fugitives) in Schoenberg's piano orchestration and the differing articulations of different lines. Although the language is very much Schoenberg's, the piano coloring (for lack of a better term)  is much of its time and like a good deal of Prokofiev's piano music, transcends it.<U+FEFF>"
"580","Schonberg","the gigue is simply irresistible! all the syncopated rhythms and tritones!! yessss<U+FEFF>"
"581","Schonberg","Splendid perfomance! Bravo Florent!<U+FEFF>"
"582","Schonberg","ëå<U+697D>ªÎãÁÚ¤ª«ªµªìª¿ªÈª­Úâ<U+6570>ª¬åïªÇªâ<U+5F3E>ª±ªëªÃªÆª¤ªÃªÈªÃª¿ªï<U+FEFF>"
"583","Schonberg","Este modo de hacer musica suena siempre (inevitablemente, por mas que se pretenda lo contrario) nervioso y desagradable. Y cuando pretende ser agradable, se queda en frio y aburrido. Solo tiene sentido como forma de transmitir el sinsentido, valga la paradoja. Como banda sonora de un film de misterio o terror, o en ciertas obras cuya naturaleza requiera una estetica feista (dedicadas a la angustia existencial, los horrores de la guerra o los campos de exterminio). Si no es asi, entonces es una broma pesada.

El problema de esta musica no es que exista (puede responder a determinados propositos), es su abuso y su descontextualizacion, y todo porque el iluminao de Schonberg la desarrollo no como un recurso disonante y feo (empleado como tal), sino como un supuesto marco de creacion equivalente a la musica armonica, o incluso como una expansion o superacion, un ""nuevo horizonte de referencia"". Error. Si TODOS los musicos de TODAS las culturas han evitado la disonancia o hecho un uso moderado de ella (y con ciertos fines) es por algo, no por ""inmovilismo"".

El ser humano tiende de forma innata a apreciar y crear formas armonicas. Desear lo contrario es antinatural. Es parecido a lo que hacen comunistas y anarquistas con la democracia: pretenden ir mas alla de la igualdad bien entendida (iguales en dignidad, en oportunidades y en libertad de expresion). Dicen: ""todos debemos ser exactamente iguales"". Quieren crear asi una sociedad mas plena, y lo que se obtiene es una sociedad tiranica (comunismo) o caotica (anarquismo). No entienden que cierta desigualdad es algo natural en la sociedad humana. La democracia llevada al extremo implicaria absurdos como dar la misma importancia a la opinion de ""asesinar es bueno"" y a la de ""asesinar es malo"". A veces hay que ""discriminar"".  

Esto se aplica tambien a la musica: uno no deberia atarse a formas rigidas y academicistas que se erigen en ""guardianas de las esencias"" , y deberia contemplar todas las posibilidades creativas, pero tampoco deberia negar la existencia de ciertos patrones (no impuestos, sino naturales) de los que emana eso que llamamos musica, distinguible del ruido. 

""Bueno, pero en toda musica hay ciertos elementos mas o menos sutiles de atonalidad y disonancia"". Ya. Del mismo modo que en toda comida hay mas o menos sal y mas o menos picante. ¢¯Tu te comerias un chile entero y rebozado en sal?

El musico de vanguardia dice: ""el topico idealista ha considerado solo una forma particular de belleza femenina, como si las mujeres que no responden a dicho estereotipo no pudieran ser hermosas"". Y no le falta razon. Pero, acto seguido, te presenta una gorila maquillada y te dice: ""esto tambien es belleza femenina, no la aceptas porque eres un retrogrado aferrado al idealismo"".

""Pero, ¢¯y la calidad tecnica y compositiva de Schonberg? ¢®Es pura maestria matematica! ¢®Su musica es un placer por ese motivo!"". No. El arte no es conmovedor solo porque sea intelectualmente complejo. El disfrute artistico no es solo el del intelecto. Sera otro tipo de disfrute pero no el propiamente artistico. Un adefesio arquitectonico de Gehry es un monumento feo y hortera al ego de su autor. Una catedral o un edificio del siglo XIX son bellos. ""Oh, pero fijate en la proeza estructural y de ingenieria del edificio de Gehry"". Me da igual. El resultado es aberrante, gratuito y se impone irrespetuosamente a su entorno. Que sea tanto o incluso mas complejo tecnicamente que una catedral me importa un bledo.<U+FEFF>"
"584","Schonberg","This sounds like trash.<U+FEFF>"
"585","Schonberg","Is B-flat or B-natural supposed to represent ""H""?<U+FEFF>"
"586","Schonberg","I actually enjoy listening to this. I think it has an interesting sound. I understand the concepts behind this music, but I still listen to it for pleasure and not academically.<U+FEFF>"
"587","Schonberg","Thanks I hate it<U+FEFF>"
"588","Schonberg","Por un momento escuche una tonalidad :o<U+FEFF>"
"589","Schonberg","Delicious!<U+FEFF>"
"590","Schonberg","flats and sharps no thanks...<U+FEFF>"
"591","Schonberg","I wouldn¡¯t be surprised if this inspired Meshuggah.<U+FEFF>"
"592","Schonberg","Thanks for uploading this.<U+FEFF>"
"593","Schonberg","This work is genius<U+FEFF>"
"594","Schonberg","So I have a belief that every piece of music has an underlying tonal centre, so I want to try this out here. 
For the prelude, I concluded that the piece ends in the key of C. I determined that by trying out different bass notes with the fifths to hear which one sounded most resolved, and so the key of C was the one to my ears. Looking at the score, I tried to analyze why, and I think it's because the low bass notes in the last bar are G's, which seem to act like a dominant pedal note causing the upper notes to harmonically sound in relation to it. 
This makes sense to me, but I'm curious to what others think, is there any problems in my approach and why?<U+FEFF>"
"595","Schonberg","Does anybody know the meaning of those markings in the last movement? I've never seen those before<U+FEFF>"
"596","Schonberg","0:01<U+FEFF>"
"597","Schonberg","Isn't it funny that when people don't understand a piece of music, it becomes automatically trash, degenerated, painful, worthless, waste of time, and so on and so forth...? Nice comments, by the way<U+FEFF>"
"598","Schonberg","Super difficult serialist piece on YouTube has 132K views? There's hope for humanity, yet!<U+FEFF>"
"599","Schonberg","Saaaammmmmmeee<U+FEFF>"
"600","Schonberg","Lovely!<U+FEFF>"
"601","Schonberg","NICE!<U+FEFF>"
"602","Schonberg","This may be my favorite atonal piece. However I'm still trying to appreciate them more.<U+FEFF>"
"603","Schonberg","It's funny but similar to the description I'm investigating the similarities of Schoenberg and Bach.<U+FEFF>"
"604","Schonberg","What the hell am I listening to<U+FEFF>"
"605","Schonberg","12:35? So much for serialism?<U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+FEFF>"
"606","Schonberg","I was trained that the entirely complete twelve tone piece was the piece that came after this The Woodwind Quintet. This piece was his Swan Song from tonality. Nevertheless the journey from Opus 1 forward to opus 25 was totally amazing as well as organic. Everyone should try this trip through his entire opus' and witness how his language logically developed unlike his successors. Whoops did they all forget he was the creator of this concept. He was so nice not to make it too complicated however the result was too complicated for the  listeners to understand.<U+FEFF>"
"607","Schonberg","I get annoyed when people dont think of this as a good piece just beccause its not relaxing.<U+FEFF>"
"608","Schonberg","hmm, guess I'm more of a debussy guy. is he still an example of modern music? I wanted to appreciate more than just Chopin (such a fan of him), but this just isn't making it for me.<U+FEFF>"
"609","Schonberg","08:38<U+FEFF>"
"610","Schonberg","I composed works like this when I got a piano and couldn't play. unfortunatly there was noone to write it down lol<U+FEFF>"
"611","Schonberg","The entire 12 tone movement was not meant to destroy harmony but the latter crowd of Babbitt, Stockhausen, and Boulez reached this hideous goal. Now we composers are returning to the creator of the theory finding that he never was unharmonic.  Shouldn't the people who adapted Schoenberg attempt to further his sound still keeping their own personality. Schonberg often divided his 12 tone row into two sixpack modes.<U+FEFF>"
"612","Schonberg","Grows on you with repeated listenings, especially if you also (attempt to) play it. Schoenberg's<U+00A0>goal was the ""emancipation of the dissonance,"" and as such, calling him an atonal composer is totally backwards.<U+00A0>He set out to exploit all of the possibilities in the tonal system, even the disturbing and jarring ones, and to use<U+00A0>what he<U+00A0>discovered in the service of his compositions. The abandonment of scales is a nonissue, because he develops a new vocabulary for each piece.<U+FEFF>"
"613","Schonberg","This is not music that makes you humming a melody theme or even tune that gives you anything but killing time and listen that someone may play the piano very well.  I instead stick to Hungarian Rhapsodies by Liszt or Shostakovich piano concertos.<U+FEFF>"
"614","Schonberg","Kinda sad that this guy went from writing Transfigured Night to this.<U+FEFF>"
"615","Schonberg","This is not atonal at all, it sounds great!! I don't know what people are on about, there are Brahmsian melodies and Bachian polyphony everywhere, it's beautiful! :)<U+FEFF>"
"616","Schonberg","who is the pianist?<U+FEFF>"
"617","Schonberg","The ""undeserved reputation"" is also th use of old forms to support an entirely new language.<U+FEFF>"
"618","Schonberg","The poster over estimated the influence of the performer. Read the sheet music and hit the right keys in the right order and if it's well composed it will be fine.<U+FEFF>"
"619","Schonberg","A disregard for traditional music forms, basically freedom for the artist.<U+FEFF>"
"620","Schonberg","The Mirror must be patting himself on the back for enjoying such nonsense.<U+FEFF>"
"621","Schonberg","Called degenerate music for a reason.<U+FEFF>"
"622","Schonberg","Well, this is garbage. :)<U+FEFF>"

"626","Ives","Wow. Thanks for creating and posting this version.<U+FEFF>"
"627","Ives","Thank you for putting this together, I enjoyed listening to it. I treasure the original composition and find some of the criticism here bizarre. Nothing wrong with spending time with a part of the whole, such as during oral sex. I suppose the critics here have never admired a single figure in a painting outside of the context of the entire work. Fear not, there's still time.<U+FEFF>"
"628","Ives","I like Ives' original, but this is also beautiful. Ives was a genius and there is nothing wrong with taking a beautiful part of one of his pieces and listening to it.<U+FEFF>"
"629","Ives","I just loved this. I loved the point of the original piece, but most certainly dissonances aren't for everyone. Yes, it obbliterates the core of music of this period, but so would be adding jazz drums and bass to Bach's music, and in any case there's no need to pull tantrums, it's just some people's tastes.<U+FEFF>"
"630","Ives","I believe it's a picture of Earth from a satellite far far away and the Earth just so happened to be caught in a ray of sunlight<U+FEFF>"
"631","Ives","Where did you find the picture you used at the start?? It's beautiful.
And thanks for this, it's beautiful :)<U+FEFF>"
"632","Ives","This is merely nice, denuding the music of that all important 'other' that makes it not merely nice music, but great music.  I don't care what you do with recordings, cut out the first three notes, but don't call it Charles Ives, because this isn't what he wanted.  It's what you want.  <U+FEFF>"
"633","Ives","A unique, intense effect that's a simplification of the original, but it works remarkably well. Like all texts this one is out in the world in with a life of its own.  Eliminating the 'answers' does not harm the piece (possibly no one now knows what the final form was supposed to be, if there was one- Ives kept changing it). This makes me think of the a single, lonely being uttering its unique aloneness, perhaps before there were any busy little beings. Your creative instincts were dead on DWXII<U+FEFF>"
"634","Ives","I also prefer this version. No dissonances needed!<U+FEFF>"
"635","Ives","You deleted the ""question""<U+FEFF>"
"636","Ives","spartan117q13 
I do not agree. The different instruments is indeed the original but without the instruments this piece of art is much more relax to listen to. I prefer this version. <U+FEFF>"
"637","Ives","The strings definitely convey the tremendous magnitude and eteranl nature of existence (in a more cosmic sense) and our insignificance. Charles ives original piece is a work of genius but sometimes its nice to listen to just the strings as it can help one feel better about life and look at its vastness and our tiny lives in a more positive light. Its good for the mind! The original piece is obviously unbelievable, but this is still nice.<U+FEFF>"
"638","Ives","The point of the original was that the dissonance in life is also there to be ' enjoyed'...The briefness of beauty and peace can be appreciated so much more intense if there is dissonance, upeaval and unrest lurking. Tough this is quite  a nice piece to listen to, the fact that the 'ugly' parts have been removed, also throws out the balance. <U+FEFF>"
"639","Ives","well the whole point was the different instruments representing different voices so now it's worthless
<U+FEFF>"
"640","Ives","Ugh. Whoever violated one of the most important (to me, but also the development of Western music as a whole) pieces of the 20th century...well go and listen to Mantovani or light classical if you don't get why the dissonances are there, and the whole point of the piece. That also goes for anyone below saying it's 'nicer' or more 'beautiful' - the whole point of the piece is the three-fold juxtaposition, it's the conflict that's unanswered, it's why it's so moving. Delete that and you're left with no Question, No Answer, just 'The'. Philistines.<U+00A0><U+FEFF>"
"641","Ives","whats the point? if you just wanna hear that bit, why not just listen to the first section before the trumpet enters? why tamper with a genius work of music?<U+FEFF>"
"642","Ives","I dont like that horn either ... its so unfitting. so my friend - thanks :) this give me chills every time...<U+FEFF>"
"643","Ives","I LOVE IT!!!<U+FEFF>"
"644","Ives","I didn't know there was another version other than this! I still love this best. It is spare, haunting, and a direct, humble but challenging question to God. It is the one piece of music I heard over and over in my head as I watched 9/11 unfold.<U+FEFF>"
"645","Ives","Modifications, edits are very common in classical music.
Tempi, size of forces used are all part of the creative expression of art process.
Leonard Bernstein at the Fall of the Wall Concert, Christmas Day, 1989 changed a few Friedrich Schiller's words in the final chorus for this occasion.
The great composers, Beethoven, Mahler, Bach gave concerts and only conducted segments of an entire work.
This is brilliant what Johan Cappaert did here.
Thank you very much, Johan.
When I was very young I was very interested in classical music.
At that time I loved the music from the Wagner operas.
I didn't care too much for the singing and I was too young and immature to sit through an entire one of his operas.
So, when the opera without words trend began I was elated.
What Johan has done here is made this work more accessable to those just starting in classical music or who know nothing about classical music who would never<U+00A0>

consider listening to Charles Ives.
""I just wish those sounds weren't squawking. It's beautiful except for that"", was what I heard during my 15 years working at Tower Records Classical.
Some will discover the rest of the piece, possibly read about it and, hopefully, about Charles Ives.
It's like the new genre of video game scoring. It seems to be bringng people to classical music too.<U+00A0>
Possibly because many of these composers are taking from the greats! Lol...

"655","Stravinsky","people complaining about the way the orchestra moves while they play get on my nerves... like, haven't you ever been really into a piece of music?<U+FEFF>"
"656","Stravinsky","I really enjoy this excellent performance with an engaging conductor.  Excellent recording as well.  I love the way the broad range of dynamics has been captured.<U+FEFF>"
"657","Stravinsky","I love how incredibly excited the orchestra looks. Very high energy performance.<U+FEFF>"
"658","Stravinsky","When a conductor gives a clear down beat and communicates, anything is possible.<U+FEFF>"
"659","Stravinsky","Best trumpets and bassoons, clarinets, oboes, flutes and cor anglais I ever heard playing this piece. Wonderful all round. Captures the joy/tragedy of Petrouchka and the fabulous, exotic,russian, playful, virtuoso orchestration by Stravinsky. Still the most joyous piece in the whole orchestral repertoire.<U+FEFF>"
"660","Stravinsky","special thanks to the recording artists. even when playing this piece I couldn't hear all the layers and single instruments so clearly as it's shown here. mesmerised!<U+FEFF>"

"663","Stravinsky","The very first ballet I conducted at the State Theatre in Pretoria - a hell of an outing for a beginner ballet conductor. Also L'Apres Midi, Spectre de la Rose and Les Sylphides on the same programme. A night to remember. Since then I've probably conducted going on for 800 to 1000 ballet performances. Lost count !<U+FEFF>"
"664","Stravinsky","i spent 6 years of my life searching for this. i'm 16. that means i spent 3/8 of my life looking for this. THIS is how iconic Stravinsky is. I listened to it once on a sitcom and I've been searching for this ever since.<U+FEFF>"
"665","Stravinsky","a swarm of bees and other gorgeous insects feeding urgently on a great carpet of lavender in flower, in furious harmony, creating a wonderful buzz and hum, with rest times, before renewed assault<U+FEFF>"
"666","Stravinsky","In my humble opinion I think the RCO is one of the best orchestra's in the world. Not mere technically but also regarding musical coherency and sound, the latter which I find incredible noble and warm...the acoustics of the concert hall alone is one of the finest in the world! Thank you so much for posting this remarkable rendition of this wonderful work of Stravinsky.<U+FEFF>"

"672","Stravinsky","22:14 it¢¥s magic!!!<U+FEFF>"
"673","Stravinsky","love the hand gesture at 24:24.<U+00A0> don't think I've ever seen a conductor do something so cute.<U+00A0> and I also saw him resting the baton in his left hand on the railing, would loved to have seen what his right hand was doing without the baton.<U+00A0> he's quite expressive.<U+00A0> love the frowns.<U+00A0> love the smiles.<U+FEFF>"

"718","Stravinsky","Love Stravinsky.  First time I heard The Firebird in 1970 it was a Damascus moment for me.  Petrouchka was the 2nd piece I listened to.  Couldn't believe that such music existed.  This is a wonderful rendition.  Ecstasy to have been in the audience.<U+FEFF>"
"719","Stravinsky","11:42 is definitely my favourite part ... Sounds like a Professor Layton soundtrack.<U+FEFF>"
"720","Stravinsky","For my ears and feel one of the most beautiful works ever been written!!! Great interpretion here with an extraordinary orchestra and a brilliant conductor and that in a wonderful recording! 
I have some old vinyls with this ensemble and Neville Marriner and they all are excellent.
Btw: I looove great orchestras like here (six basses and all that...) because of the sheer loudness, energy and power..
Just to mention it: Love the ladies with the flutes.
Thank you for that time of pure bliss!!!
Regards from Berlin
A happy listener<U+FEFF>"

"772","Stravinsky","Russian composers on rhe XX century flew higher than any others: no doubt! Yet the very best far from Stravinsky and Shostakovich was Rachmaninov. Here however is a very exquisite piece of Igor as well as The Firebird.
Nice performance too.<U+FEFF>"

"784","Stravinsky","I find the Russian composers far more appealing than the classical European composers.  I find Stravinsky mesmerizing.<U+FEFF>"
"785","Stravinsky","Love this interpretation, but that Flute Player is having a seizure!<U+FEFF>"
"786","Stravinsky","Entendo nada de musica classica. Mas achei a sonoridade e evolucao da musica imprevisivel e variada. Nao fica morgado. Mas a quebra de ritmo talvez n seja tao boa. De td forma se compensa pela variacao. Lembra desenhos animados.<U+FEFF>"

"793","Stravinsky","Wie viele der Orchestermitglieder sind, Ihrer Meinung nach, niederlandisch? :)<U+FEFF>"
"794","Stravinsky","That is really interesting! I had no idea!! thanx for the info :). And this does sound beautiful! a little intimidating for me because I will be performing this with an orchestra in the 26th of October. Scary yet exciting<U+FEFF>"

Love this piece.<U+FEFF>"
"804","Stravinsky","This guy's gonna be the new bso conductor!!!<U+FEFF>"
"805","Stravinsky","I agree. For someone who has heard other interpretations this is abit lukewarm. NOT BAD, but it doesn't have that electric pulse that is so...STRAVINSKIAN. I first heard this (as a kid) from a CBS recording with Stravinsky himself conducting. But I wouldn't call it sloppy. Peace:)<U+FEFF>"
"806","Stravinsky","This is an exuberantly joyful piece!!  It's about puppets/dolls that came alive! :)<U+FEFF>"
"807","Stravinsky","Sloppy playing or sloppy conducting? Compared to Boulez and Cleveland this is a disaster indeed....<U+FEFF>"
"808","Stravinsky","I am glad you and others like it. Being in minority does not mean I am wrong.<U+FEFF>"
"809","Stravinsky","I and an overwhelming majority of viewers like it very much.<U+FEFF>"
"810","Stravinsky","HELL YES this guy's the next BSO music director!<U+FEFF>"
"811","Stravinsky","Conductor hardly looks up from score. Orchestra hardly looks at conductor.... Quite an uninteresting performance....<U+FEFF>"
"812","Stravinsky","bravo!<U+FEFF>"
"813","Stravinsky","Tony from South Philadelphia thinks this version is just AWSOME!!!! Go PO!!
<U+FEFF>"
"814","Stravinsky","Just thinking that myself. I guess it'll have to be a duel?<U+FEFF>"
"815","Stravinsky","The best batch yet<U+FEFF>"
"816","Stravinsky","American?<U+FEFF>"
"817","Stravinsky","Great. Everyone's feeding off the conductor's - and each other's energy.<U+FEFF>"
"818","Stravinsky","Nice job concertmaster, but you still killed Dumbledore.<U+FEFF>"
"819","Stravinsky",":) great
<U+FEFF>"
"820","Stravinsky","Petrouchka and the Psalmns are my favorite Stravinsky's pieces - the Intro of the music  has fantastic rhythmic/harmonic cells (or dare I say motivs). Superb recording here<U+FEFF>"
"821","Stravinsky","Not my favorite Stravinsky work, but definitely the weirdest and out of the blues one. It has its good parts.<U+FEFF>"
"822","Stravinsky","I wouldn't mind taking the second flutist out to dinner!<U+FEFF>"
"823","Stravinsky","You are Right, Just now watched his performance of  Also Sparch Zarasthustra<U+FEFF>"
"824","Stravinsky","You Mean Gustavo Dudamel<U+FEFF>"
"825","Stravinsky","Sure the orkester /conductor ..contributes to the vivid performance but dont you think the great music is to ""blame"" ? As for the ""dead'"" - avoid and listen to the Venecual's Youth orkestra even when not conducted by Dada ..(Sorry I dont remember the name)<U+FEFF>"
"826","Stravinsky","How do you know he's American?<U+FEFF>"
"827","Stravinsky","Giuliano Sommerhalder! He will be at the Vienna Philharmonic one time, I promise.<U+FEFF>"
"828","Stravinsky","this is less psychotic than the piano version
<U+FEFF>"
"829","Stravinsky","Bartok used tritones heavily as well, the Miraculous Mandarin is awash in them, as is the Shrovetide Fair.  And both Bartok and Stravinsky utilized folk melodies, Roumanian/Magya and Russian respectively.  The use of simple melodies (themes) with polytonality and constantly changing rhythms make the music of both composers special.  The interpretation here is one of the best I've heard.  Bartok's Divertimento for Strings is tritonalism in overdrive.<U+FEFF>"
"830","Stravinsky","Nice rendition !
Thanks<U+FEFF>"
"831","Stravinsky","You can still be happy even though you don't smile.. A smile just shows that you have energy and time to show your happiness to others!<U+FEFF>"
"832","Stravinsky",":O
<U+FEFF>"
"833","Stravinsky","i need to explore this further--thank you.<U+FEFF>"
"834","Stravinsky","I get the feeling the conductor wasn't too familiar with the score as he had to look down at his score quite often, more than typical.  Nonetheless, I like his interpretation.  <U+FEFF>"
"835","Stravinsky","Yes.  And Tritones also.  The prominence of the tritone interval is prevalent, both melodically and harmonically. This interval is a common one separating melodies of a bitonal nature (Polytonality), and Stravinsky frequently used scales that contain tritones as source material for his melodies.  Stravisnky was THE 20th century's musical genius.  <U+FEFF>"
"836","Stravinsky","If you think these guys move when they play check out the Berlin Phil! They gave the rest of the orchestral world permission.<U+FEFF>"
"837","Stravinsky","Bloody hell!! Listen to this beatiful music and stop complaning about video registration!! One of the most perfect interpretations for me. Macnifficant!! And don't you see in the mirror every day again. Alway's the same..... Francisco. <U+FEFF>"
"838","Stravinsky","One of the best recordings and performances I've heard of Petrushka, absolutely beautiful... Hail Stravinsky!!!<U+FEFF>"
"839","Stravinsky","of course, in fact look up in wikipedia about the Petrushka chord :D<U+FEFF>"
"840","Stravinsky","I was talking about the one at @17:07 but that one too sounds great<U+FEFF>"
"841","Stravinsky","18:20?<U+FEFF>"
"842","Stravinsky","impresionante<U+FEFF>"
"843","Stravinsky","this is pretty sloppy<U+FEFF>"
"844","Stravinsky","Not a good video production. Cameras focus on same flute, clarinets and trumpets constantly. They forget the piano, celesta, the harps, percussion and other important soloists. Never saw the cornets either.  But sound is excellent.

<U+FEFF>"
"845","Stravinsky","are parts of this bi-tonal?  Stravinsky such a genius--voted top composer of the 20th century by Time!<U+FEFF>"
"846","Stravinsky","yes, but this guy is low key compared to 'Mr. Hair and Arms Swinging""--Dudemel--now THAT guy really is irritating.  <U+FEFF>"
"847","Stravinsky","nearly as atrocious as Nezet-Seguin and Alsop, might I add<U+FEFF>"
"848","Stravinsky","a face nicely buried in the score. well done to the conductor.<U+FEFF>"
"849","Stravinsky","Great conductors don't need to have a score in front of them, this score is easy to memorise.<U+FEFF>"

"853","Stravinsky","I concur with rdnz123. i have the full score in front of me- The decending bass figure in question is heard 3 times over a 9 second period. At 7.43 it ends on a low 'e'. The second time, at 7.48 it ends a semitone higher on an 'f'.Then the final time, at 7.52 it ends on an 'e' again.<U+FEFF>"

Thanks a lot<U+FEFF>"
"866","Stravinsky","Wonderful!  Leaves nothing to be desired, but I'm curious on one point:  Is this the 1911 version or the 1947, which is slightly re-orchestrated for a marginally smaller group?<U+FEFF>"

"874","Stravinsky","Great performance, terrible camera work. Did no one alert the director that whole sections of this work are in effect a concerto for piano and orchestra? Now and then, it'd be nice to see the pianist's fingers. I've played that part and it's NOT even remotely easy!<U+FEFF>"

"878","Stravinsky","The music of my difficult childhood. Love it.<U+FEFF>"
"879","Stravinsky","The conductor's enthusiasm is sweet- like a student- like a kid in a candy store. He conducts rather like I used to ' conduct' to recordings on the stereo when I was a teenager; lots of unecessary gestures that communicate his physical response to the music, if nothing else. But even as a teenager I could have lifted my head from the score for more than half a bar at a time. But, yes- what a score! The ear never tires of it. And the the erruption at 28.34? One of the great moments in music!<U+FEFF>"

"888","Stravinsky","Quite fun. The conductor keeps his head in the score . .  ?? Maybe, like Bernstein, he wants every performance wants to be one of ""discovery"" -- the conductor 'discovers' the piece anew every time. This [youthful] orchestra seems to respond with vigor and freedom. It would be nice if the editing o the video showed a bit more of his conducting.<U+FEFF>"

Is there some updated version or something where the piano switches parts?  It's odd to me because in the (maybe) original the piano is out of place for the character of the melody--but that's just an opinion.  Still a brilliant and energetic performance.<U+FEFF>"

"963","Stravinsky","The Igor Stravinsky¡¯s ballet for the Ballet Russes was Petrushka: Ballet Burlesque in Four Scenes (Opus 16). The composer dedicated this ballet to his Russian friend, the artist and scenographer Alexandre Benois (1870-1960). Stravinsky worked in the composition while he was traveling in Lausanne, Clarens, Beaudie and Rome (August 1910 <U+2013> May 1911). In the first presentation (43¡¯), the orchestra was conducted by Pierre Monteux (1875-1964), in the Theatre du Chatelet, in Paris (June 13, 1911). This charming and tragic ballet showed the drama of two puppets that a magician brought to life, in a pantomime that became a huge success in all the presentations. Sergey Diaghilev (1972-1929) received designs by Jacques-Emile Blanche (1861-1942), but chosed.to present the ballet with the costumes and scenery by Alexandre Benois (1870-1960). The choreographer was Michel Fokine (Mikhail Mikhailovich Fokin, c. 1880/1-1942), and the most important dancer was Vaslav Nijinsky (1889-1950), that danced au pair with Tamara Platnovna Kasarvina (1885-1978) as a mechanical doll. The Russian dancer Alexandre Orlov was the Moor that killed the lover Petrouchka (Nijinsky). The photo of the charming Kasarvina dressed as a doll, is reproduced (Shead, 1989, page 48). In the second presentation, Nijinsky dressed as Petrouchka posed with I. Stravinsky, and the photo is reproduced (Shead, 1989). Petrouchka was also presented in the north American tour of the Ballets Russes (1916). I loved this presentation of the Concertgebouw Orchestra, but I would like to have more informations about this presentation, for example when, where, etc...

"968","Stravinsky","Nelsons is enthusiastic enough, and this is bright. There are a few strident horns that you wouldn't notice unless you heard this repeatedly, which I plan to do, as soon as I look up what Stravinsky meant by all of it. 
Don't be a hater. Don't hate people who hate. Try to love them. You don't have to completely love haters but just sometimes ""like"" people who hate. That way haters will feel less bad about themselves and maybe hate less.<U+FEFF>"
"969","Stravinsky","First time I listened to this . I'm suprised . I thought Stravinsky would be far more ""modern "" and "" difficult"" . Some of it sounds a bit like old film background music . I know a lot of European lesser kbown composers were draughted into Hollywood so maybe they were influenced by him .<U+FEFF>"

"1025","Prokofiev","The music is outstanding and I loved the narration<U+FEFF>"
"1026","Prokofiev","Oh dear. I don't think I've ever heard the whole piece and the whole story. We didn't have it at home and I'm apparently exactly the generation at which Czech teachers decided to drop Russian music from the curriculum or something (my sister has heard it at school, I haven't - at least not the whole thing and not until much later). This was such a fun performance, thank you for sharing.<U+FEFF>"

This live performance also looks like a rare opportunity for parents to enjoy a bit of culture with their children in a welcome setting. A sort of rare opportunity for children to get some social training under supervision.<U+FEFF>"

Had big shoes to fill. Omg. I Loved it. It really brought me out of my shell. The music is so haunting and beautiful. Still fascinated. Play it for me please.<U+FEFF>"

"1084","Prokofiev","love it!!! narration is good too!<U+FEFF>"
"1085","Prokofiev","I don't know why I'm always driven to tears by ""Peter and the Wolf"". It is a simple and innocent story. I just can't hold my emotions in when I hear the interactions between the different characters (instruments). My favorite part is that the music tells you who, what, when, where and even how, a scene plays out. The narration is fantastic, but even without it, the choice of instrument, the tempo, intensity and mood of the music is enough to paint the picture in its entirety.<U+FEFF>"
"1086","Prokofiev","I remember going to this symphony when I was 12 years old in 1972 in Vancouver.
Same dialogue, music stimulates your imagination. Smelly french horns and crying kids. Better than rap and whatever the younger generation call it. Close your eyes and open your imagination Hayley.<U+FEFF>"

"1170","Kodaly","The sweat dripping down his cello says it all. Such an intense piece and played so beautifully.<U+FEFF>"
"1171","Kodaly","Beautiful! I love the way you interpret music. It's like you are telling a story. And as a listener (and cellist myself), I adore the way of playing that is like saying ""That's what the composer meant by writing these notes"". Thanks for uploading your Kodaly!<U+FEFF>"
"1172","Kodaly","Truly stunning - an absolute masterpiece masterfully played. So excited to start learning this tomorrow!<U+FEFF>"

"1184","Kodaly","This piece is one of the greatest masterwork written for cello. The performance is absolutely perfect. Actually, I'd like to hear the point of view of the seventeen persons who pressed ""dislike""..<U+FEFF>"

"1191","Varese","if you were walking in the forrest and discovered a lost tape, it would be this.<U+FEFF>"
"1192","Varese","when i think of sound, in-particular, electronic sound.
its suppose to be static, objective, not have any emotional kind of association.
the sounds here compiled by varese Edgard
i find it hard to not to be affected or un-consciously my ears and mind judge and automatically find some association to these sounds
maybe its survival based, trying to interpret threats or signs of calm in my environment
its almost like asking if sound can ever be totally objective with no association
the way these sounds are compiled its like going through a range of feelings,
although its just sound<U+FEFF>"
"1193","Varese","this makes me think of Pikmin 2's sountrack... some of the cave music in that game is very reminiscent of this XD<U+FEFF>"

"1200","Varese","Great stuff<U+FEFF>"
"1201","Varese","... this is... interesting I guess? Some neat sounds in there but... how do I put this... it feels completely disjointed... I heard harsh noise more coherent then this x.x
Gives me the same feel like just letting a recorder running for a while, taking the recording and glitching it via data corruption and then listening what I get. Randomness with some neat sounds but without any semblence of structure...
Though, I kinda have the feeling that this is kinda the point.<U+FEFF>"

"1236","Varese","It's called musique concrete, although it has more electronic elements to it than pure musique concrete. Try listening to some more of varese's work.<U+FEFF>"

"1242","Varese","We must admit it after this piece: aliens do live among us<U+FEFF>"
"1243","Varese","What you see here is embarrassing. This version of Le poeme electronique was made in 1998 for a Dutch VPRO television documentary ""Varese in Nederland"" and was never meant to be publicly available after the documentary was aired.
Someone must have recorded it on VHS and put it on Youtube later, without any credits or sources mentioned. 
It is one of the first attempts to combine the music by Varese with images on the ecrans and the colours in Le Corbusier's scenario after the Philips Pavilion was demolished in 1959, but it is not accurate at all and many elements from Le Corbusier¡¯s so-called ambiances are missing.
Unfortunately, many people think that this is THE Poeme, but it is not.
If you have a teacher who tells you to study this version then obviously, he doesn't know much about the subject.<U+FEFF>"

For you young 'uns out there, you've no idea how painstaking it was to create a piece of music like this.  Add to that, it says something about the enormous creatvity and plasticity of mind of Varese, that, so late in his career he was still at the cutting edge of music tech (as it was in 1958).  Thanks again!<U+FEFF>"

It's all very entertaining but  in all honestly this is a whole other thing. If anything we should be discussing what the fuck this means. Does anybody know what the fuck this means? I sure as hell don't. It's interesting but I really  am clueless. How about we at least discuss and argue that one. <U+FEFF>"

"1345","Varese","I don't take drugs, so am unable to relate to the comments of those who do, but as to wether or not Varese's 'Poeme' goes hand-in-hand with them I can't say.

"1360","Varese","@Timelander4d Youtube doesn't do the piece justice, it's intended to be listened to with a complex audio setup. The original presentation at the World Fair involved 350 speakers, and was quite a feat of audio engineering for its time.<U+FEFF>"
"1361","Varese","@Metamusik That's exactly what I think. lol j/k - definitely not dissing this piece. I thoroughly appreciate it. It has earned its' place in history.<U+FEFF>"
"1362","Varese","Folks seem to have mixed-up two different questions here: This is obviously music, very influential and ground-breaking music I might add, but this doesn't automatically mean it's good. I might not agree with all the works of Picasso, for example, but claiming that he didn't produce paintings is just plain ridiculous. As to whether this piece is ""good"", I personally think this format is very limiting: it was made as part of an installation. Guernica isn't very impressive as a JPG either.<U+FEFF>"
"1363","Varese","@oneriver101 The classic modern definition of music is ""organized sound"", reputedly coined by Edgard Varese, one of the composers of what you just heard. This particular piece obviously fits that definition with ease. The definition can actually be used to categorize far more than you might think at first. Like Cage's classic ""3:44"", where the only thing truly organized is the time... or even completely random, everyday sound where the organizer is the listener who choose what to focus on.<U+FEFF>"
"1364","Varese","@DrMadvillain  This is not noise. This is Edgar Varese.<U+FEFF>"

"1366","Varese","that¢¥s the original video? can someone tell me where do these images com from?<U+FEFF>"
"1367","Varese","Not to sound ignorant at all cause I really don't want to seem that way at all.  I don't fully understand how this is music? Can someone explain it to me? Maybe I'm just not understanding this correctly lol can someone explain it to me?<U+FEFF>"
"1368","Varese","@TrollSturm what is music?<U+FEFF>"
"1369","Varese","@hgchjk That's what she said.

"1370","Varese","I just wanna know if there's anywhere i could see a good photo of the philips pavillion in it's heyday... INSIDE AND OUT! or at least a good recreation. and was it just under 400 speakers in surround sound or just over?<U+FEFF>"
"1371","Varese","@Metamusik Just 'cause it took time and effort doesn't mean it's good. Babies take 9 months and I know plenty of idiots.<U+FEFF>"
"1372","Varese","Thats not what Varese thought.<U+FEFF>"
"1373","Varese","compared to modern genres, it's more like noise-music than electronic :D<U+FEFF>"
"1374","Varese","what kind of bull*****t is this??????????? the maker and all the people that like it SHOULD DIE!!!!!!!!!<U+FEFF>"
"1375","Varese","intro translated:<U+FEFF>"
"1376","Varese","Philips has designed an automatic device, one that heralds new art with unlimited possibilities, namely the electronic interplay of light, color, image, word and music in the room.<U+FEFF>"
"1377","Varese","The 'electronic poem ""curated by Le Corbusier, Xenakis and his assistant Yean musician Edgard Varese, shows how our increasingly mechanized civilization strives for a new future harmony.
The show consists of the following parts:
creation
mind and matter
from darkness to dawn
gods created by man
thus forging the time civilization
harmony 
and all mankind<U+FEFF>"
"1378","Varese","thanks :)<U+FEFF>"
"1379","Varese","An addition to my earlier comment- yes this is official..the music is by varese but the visual conception is by Corbusier<U+FEFF>"
"1380","Varese","People were meant to hear it as they walked through phillips pavilion at brussel's world fair in 1958..so this video may not have any official connection per se<U+FEFF>"
"1381","Varese","Wow this song is probably the best song I HAVE EVER HEARD! If only music was like this today so that I might have committed suicide to it already.

LONG LIVE CWATS not cwates<U+FEFF>"
"1382","Varese","Sadly the project was influenced somewhat through a disconnect between Le Corbusier and those working for him. In the end, the images were chosen very late in the design while the music was composed over a seven month period.<U+FEFF>"
"1383","Varese","Not only that, but it took 7 months to compose!<U+FEFF>"
"1384","Varese","Excuse me, but who made this video? I'm just wandering if it's officially linked to the song or if someone made it  under the influence of it.<U+FEFF>"
"1385","Varese","this is an acid trip. an electronic acid trip.<U+FEFF>"
"1386","Varese","I don't have a problem with that interpretation. If you judge it from those purely aesthetic standards you could be right. Of course its fascination rests on the event itself as a document of the jet age/cold war period. Kind of like Hendrix's Star Spangled Banner, actually kind of boring in itself and not even close to his best work, but in that time and place had an inescapable meaning.<U+FEFF>"
"1387","Varese","Double plus good post.<U+FEFF>"
"1388","Varese","Amazing, huh? In 1958.<U+FEFF>"
"1389","Varese","This was an exhibit at the Brussels World Fair of 1958. I think it was one of the first multimedia presentations. People walked throught the exhibit and the images were flashed on the walls while the music played. Way better than sitting looking at a computer screen.<U+FEFF>"
"1390","Varese","Just go look at ELP doing Pictures at an Exhibition, with Keith Emerson plugging and unplugging cables like an old-time switchboard operator, in the middle of the performance. Kids are just not taught any sense of history anymore.<U+FEFF>"
"1391","Varese","Don't expect a video game fed kid with a Flatland sense of history and no work ethic as was practiced back in Varese's day to get this. Also, movies have overdone this (just like with Stravinsky) and so now poor Edgard is reduced to Mystery Science Theater 3000.<U+FEFF>"
"1392","Varese","Yeah, that must have blown some minds back then, while others probably came out of the exhibit demanding that Varese and Le Corbusier be arrested.<U+FEFF>"
"1393","Varese","Varese came before Stockhausen by about 45 years and nobody was doing this stuff before him. No Varese means no Stockhausen.  I doubt Karlheinz himself would have considered 'the father of electronic music' an ""under-Stockhausen"".<U+FEFF>"
"1394","Varese","Hear, hear. Taste does not equal quality. Tracks can excel at certain qualities, and if you know your music you can spot these, even if these qualities doesn't match your personal taste.<U+FEFF>"
"1395","Varese","Ah, come on now. As soon as anything gets even the slightest bit more interesting then commercial radio, people always go ""Oh dude, they must have dropped sooo much acid"". Do you have any idea how much work and effort it takes to make these recordings with the gear they had back in the day? You think they dropped acid and then went on to do precision editing with sound generators and tape-loops and shit? Besides, tripping with this soundtrack is asking for trouble.<U+FEFF>"

"1405","Varese","Musically, I think its pretty damn worhtless, but with that said it does have a danm creepy athmoshpere to it. And for that it is good piece of art.<U+FEFF>"
"1406","Varese","It¢¥s very amazing :) Somewhen I¢¥m scared :D<U+FEFF>"
"1407","Varese","One should not be afraid to be disturbed by this piece.  How could you not?  The whole thing, from the music to the imagery to the presentation at the Expo was designed to evoke the cultural and technological triumphs and horrors of the 20th century.  E.g. the pavilion is stomach-shaped and ""digests"" the spectators; and, hello!  Atomic Bomb!

Modern(ist) art cannot and should not be held to classical or Renaissance ideas of beauty.  To do so would be to miss out on some very important lessons.<U+FEFF>"
"1408","Varese","dolphinbrain, were the images in the video the original projected images at the 1958 brussel's world's fair?<U+FEFF>"
"1409","Varese","I find more disturbing the pictures.
I encourage you, guys, to listening to the music paying no atention to the images.<U+FEFF>"
"1410","Varese","Yes, art is art. But a key to art is that there are many different interpretations of it and many opinions about it. If it were really rubbish then everyone could agree about it. Clearly this isn't the case. Anyway, can you imagine how hard it would have been in 1958 to create all these very different sounds from primitive synths of the time? There was great care and patience put into this! There was no way to just do a piece like this randomly in a few minutes. Pls don't be so quick to judge.<U+FEFF>"
"1411","Varese","I've liked this piece especially since I was a little boy, and listened to the LP of Varese. I have a whole story attached to the music...and now that I see the original images I don't feel they have much or anything to do with what I pictured! However, it's very interesting and the video can conjure an entirely different story. Sorry someone thought it was rubbish. I think it was done with care and intention and cannot be thought of as trash, just because it's non-traditional. Just my opinion.<U+FEFF>"
"1412","Varese","fuckin disturbing<U+FEFF>"
"1413","Varese","serious respect<U+FEFF>"
"1414","Varese","well of course I can! And that's something a lot of people shud learn.
I don't like HipHop - at all - but I just know, that from a musical point of view there are a lot of good tracks out there... coz these tracks stand out from other shit hip hop tracks and their certain criteria as to why they stand out I can see and appreciate. I dont have to like something to appreciate its nature
That's not paradox
(I guess that's the word you were looking for - not paranoid... paradox)<U+FEFF>"
"1415","Varese","There is a huge difference between not liking things and not respecting it.
I don't LIKE Nine Inch Nails necessarily - but i know their music is good music for some good reasons. I don't like Oasis songs very much - but only because their songs don't offer me anything - but the songs itself are good.
It's all usually way less about this matter of taste than most people think it is.<U+FEFF>"
"1416","Varese","but no one cares wot u think. Just because YOU say it's rubbish to you - doesnt mean anything.
I'm not listening to that piece every morning when i get up - but i can see why it is art. 
and you just seem to be ignorant to some things.
What have you brought up as to why this is rubbish other than your own ignorance? - Nothing<U+FEFF>"
"1417","Varese","art is art - not wot you think art is!<U+FEFF>"
"1418","Varese","and you have no effing idea wot on earth you are talking about!<U+FEFF>"
"1419","Varese","Lol on the images<U+FEFF>"
"1420","Varese","no, is becouse you are very closed minded, and very classist<U+FEFF>"
"1421","Varese","i hate wen faggot nazis like you start talking billshit and tray to impose thier ideas over the oter people

if you like to be such a douchebag, please go away

faggot nazi<U+FEFF>"
"1422","Varese","presumptuous? are you talking about you?

lol<U+FEFF>"
"1423","Varese","first of all you where who try to say first what is art and what not

so. just stop defending yourself or go away

i like this and people like you are meking the world everyday smaller and closed<U+FEFF>"
"1424","Varese","i got a brain you know,

and i see the world in a very diferent way,

so

who you think you are to tell me what is art and what not?<U+FEFF>"
"1425","Varese","im bot good at flaming, but your ignorance on the subject is large<U+FEFF>"
"1426","Varese","you need to study more abot modernism<U+FEFF>"
"1427","Varese","art is not beauty, art is expression<U+FEFF>"
"1428","Varese","no doubt that Expo 58 was brilliant. can u imagine this on the 425 loudspeakers?? man, i wish i was there.<U+FEFF>"
"1429","Varese","What a great way to experience something i haven't heard in 40 years.I had a CBS-France LP-series of French electronic composers and this was on one of the sides.Wonderful,thank you for posting ,interesting posts as well.<U+FEFF>"
"1430","Varese","Who is this animation? WHI IS THIS ANIMATION?!?! PLEASE SOME ONE TELL ME!!!!!!<U+FEFF>"
"1431","Varese","God help me for watching that. Im not sure why, but the ambience was frightening. I think Im going to have nightmares. o_o

I did like it though. It has a really eerie feel to it. :)<U+FEFF>"
"1432","Varese","see my previous post for answer.<U+FEFF>"
"1433","Varese","no she had not written it when i met her, and we did talk about her book. she was in her early nineties when i met her. the walls of the living room were covered with paintings that varese had made. she told me that painting relaxed him. we also talked about Erik Satie who is a composer that i admire and she and edgar were his friend.<U+FEFF>"
"1434","Varese","it is a gorgeous piece of music, although it's beauty may be elusive to some. i once made a visit to louise Varese at her Manhattan apartment and shared a conversation with her about her late husband and their life in the avant garde.<U+FEFF>"
"1435","Varese","None of this is crap...music history isn't crap...if anything it's fantastic to mess with your head. 

I'm sure other German electronic bands of most recent years may have taken some inspiration from this kind of stuff. Kraftwerk maybe?<U+FEFF>"
"1436","Varese","you have no idea what you are talking about.<U+FEFF>"
"1437","Varese","There are naked girls, which is one of the reasons why it is so good.<U+FEFF>"
"1438","Varese","It is artistically interesting, but this is not music to be listened to. So in some sense this is brilliant just because Varese was amongst those first to create the style. So this is brilliant crap of the past, absolute crap in the present. Dont waste your time.<U+FEFF>"
"1439","Varese","The present day composer refuses to die!<U+FEFF>"
"1440","Varese","is this brilliant crap, or is this crap brilliant?<U+FEFF>"
"1441","Varese","awesome but a little frightening for me<U+FEFF>"

"1446","Varese","I first heard this in music appreciation class. It has always fascinated me in a creepy way. I never knew this kind of technology existed in the 1950s.  I then showed it to two friends. One said the guy was smoking too much weed and the other called it electric crap.<U+FEFF>"
"1447","Varese","it's about YOU<U+FEFF>"
"1448","Varese","je suis outree<U+FEFF>"
"1449","Varese","Such a striking piece of avant-garde art film. I admit I was already listening to Ata by Xenakis on my stereo instead of the Varese piece but the film in itself is powerful in itself! Varese, Xenakis and The Phillips Pavilion is one of those once in a Life time things I wish I could have experienced. Peace!<U+FEFF>"

"1467","Varese","I'll toss out my standard argument when it comes to music like this: the definition of music used academically by musicologists and the like is ""intentional organized sound created and perceived by humans"" Which means that birdsong isn't music, but this is. Go figure!<U+FEFF>"
